#### Reading Tips
Read selectively and learn to skim over materials that are not directly relevant for the part of the assignment you are tackling at the moment, (although they may turn out to be useful later). We have indicated key pages - if you find them interesting/relevant, you may want to read the whole chapter/article. But plan your time.

Also, note that these readings are not listed in order of priority, although we have tried to indicate the more relevant sections.

You are now almost ready to start looking at planning and management issues in some detail. However first we want to briefly define the term, e-learning and discuss the impact it is having on teaching, so that the context in which planning and managing take place is fully understood.

### Key Points <a name="keypoints"></a>
There are four key points we would like you take away from this unit.

1. The Meaning of E-Learning<br>
First, it is important to develop a clear understanding of the concept of e-learning and ensure that when you are discussing it with colleagues that you are talking about the same thing. As you will see later in this unit, everybody seems to be talking about e-learning these days but finding two people who have the same understanding of the concept is a challenge. As mentioned earlier, we do not want to suggest there is a correct and an incorrect understanding of the concept, the important thing is that you clarify your understanding and recognize that others may be using the term to mean something quite different.<p>
How we understand the concept has important implications for how we organize our institutions to develop and support e-learning, for the kind support we provide learners and faculty, for how it is funded, how it relates to the mission and goals of the institution, and for the kind of organizational structures we put in place to support e-learning.<p>
As you will see later in the unit, we find it useful to think about e-learning as a continuum ranging from technology support for classroom teaching at one end to fully online distance education at the other. We also find the categories of e-learning proposed by Massy &amp; Zemsky (2004) useful:
* e-learning as distance education
* e-learning as facilitated transaction software
* e-learning as electronically-mediated learning<p>

2. Reasons for Using E-Learning<br>
Equally important as understanding the meaning of e-learning is being clear about why you want to use it. It is easy to get swept up in the the techno-utopic frenzy to be on the leading edge but you should be using e-learning to achieve some clear goals. Improving the quality of teaching and learning, broadening access, reaching new markets, cost savings, doing more with the same, are the key reasons that institutions usually turn to e-learning. You need to be sure that your reasons for using e-learning are clear and, ideally, consistent with your institution's goals for e-learning.

3. Implications for Teaching & Learning<br>
If e-learning is to be used effectively to increase access, improve quality and make higher education more cost-effective, we believe significant changes will be needed to how our institutions are organized. Without major changes to how programs are designed and delivered, adding technology to the mix will only add costs and will likely do little to address quality and access issues. Key to addressing access and costs is redesigning teaching so that different technologies and modes of delivery are exploited appropriately. Thus, in our view, e-learning is more than just enhancing teaching with technology. It implies<strong> re-thinking and re-designing learning and reorganizing institutions. It is, by definition, about integrating learning technologies into teaching and learning, not simply using them to enhance existing approaches.</strong>

### 1.1 What is E-Learning <a name="elearning"></a>
<a href="http://blogs.ubc.ca/etec5202015/files/2011/08/hourglass-icon1-e1403212651814.jpg"><img class="alignleft wp-image-3038 size-full" src="http://blogs.ubc.ca/etec5202015/files/2011/08/hourglass-icon1-e1403212651814.jpg" alt="" width="55" height="55" /></a>
We recommend that you spend about <strong>two</strong> hours on this section.
<p style="text-align: left;">One of the problems with discussing eLearning is that there are so many different understandings of the concept. Even in the literature you will find it used and defined differently by different authors. It is essential, then, that we begin with a common understanding, or at least acknowledge there are different understandings.</p>
The following video summarizes the commentary that follows.
<p style="text-align: center;"><iframe src="//player.vimeo.com/video/100808160" width="500" height="281" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>

#### The eLearning Continuum
In figure 1 we present one way of thinking about e-learning. E-learning is part of a teaching and learning continuum that begins with face-to-face teaching <strong>without</strong> the use of information and communication technologies (ICT) at one end and fully online distance learning at the other end.
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://blogs.ubc.ca/etec520/files/2010/04/eLearning-graphic-1.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-large wp-image-2441" title="eLearning graphic-1" src="http://blogs.ubc.ca/etec520/files/2010/04/eLearning-graphic-1-1024x422.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="263" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Figure 1 -The eLearning Continuum</p>
 As we move along the continuum from fully face-to-face teaching, technology is used to replace the face-to-face elements. Initially, this has very little impact on how teaching is organized and how learning occurs because the technology is used primarily to enhance the face-to-face teaching. But as we move further along the continuum, the nature of teaching and how it is organized is increasingly affected by the use of ICT. Somewhere around the middle of the continuum we have what is called blended learning.

In a blended environment, fewer face-to-face sessions are held as technology is used increasingly to deliver the teaching and to facilitate the learning. And nature of the face-to-face sessions changes. Instead of coming to class to listen to a teacher, students come to discuss, and to work and collaborate in small groups. Once we reach the right end of the continuum there is no longer any face-to-face teaching and we have fully online learning in which all teaching is technology-mediated.

<strong>E-learning is that part of the continuum that begins when technology is used to replace some of the face-to-face teaching to the point on the continuum where it replaces it all.</strong>

It's also important to understand the relationship between e-learning and distance education. These days distance education is increasingly delivered online but historically it has used other technologies and there is still a considerable amount of distance education that would not be considered e-learning. So, we can have what we call blended e-learning in which there is a combination of face-to-face and technology-mediated teaching or distance education e-learning in which all teaching and learning is done without teacher and learners ever meeting face-to-face. And there can be distance education that is primarily print-based and would not be considered e-learning.

#### Three Types of E-Learning
<a href="http://www.thelearningalliance.info/WeatherStation.html" target="_blank">Zemsky &amp; Massy (2004) </a>have proposed what we consider to be quite useful framework for understanding e-learning because it allows us to capture a diversity of understandings of the concept in three fairly easy to understand categories.

The three categories are:
1. E-learning as distance education</li>
2. E-learning as facilitated transactions software</li>
3. E-learning as electronically-mediated learning</li>
<strong><a href="http://blogs.ubc.ca/etec5202015/files/2010/04/reading-icon.png"><img class="alignleft wp-image-3032 size-full" src="http://blogs.ubc.ca/etec5202015/files/2010/04/reading-icon.png" alt="reading icon" width="80" height="104" /></a></strong>

<strong>Read Zemsky &amp; Massy (2004) for a the details of this framework. (</strong>See "Recommended Readings &amp; Resources" below.)<em><strong>
</strong></em>
#### Three Waves of ICT
Carl Bereiter and Marlene Scardamalia offer another framework that looks at the use of information and communication technologies (ICT) in education and suggests it is helpful to think of it happening in three waves. Although they use the term ICT, we think their framework can be used to understand how e-learning has diffused through our higher education system.

Wave 1: Technology as imperative. Computers (and e-learning) were seen as essential to the preparation of our students for the information age.

Wave 2: In the second wave, the focus shifted to using computers (and e-learning) in appropriate ways. It was no longer technology for technology's sake but "pedagogy before technology".

Wave 3: ICTs as affordances. In the third wave, the focus, according to Berieter and Scardamalia is where it should be: on the educational ideas. It is not so much about integrating technology into educational activities as it is about understanding the potential of various technologies and and designing educational activities that take this into account. The difference between wave 2 and wave 3 is subtle and we suggest you read the Berieter and Scardamallia article to gain a better understanding.

<strong><a href="http://blogs.ubc.ca/etec5202015/files/2010/04/reading-icon.png"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-3032" src="http://blogs.ubc.ca/etec5202015/files/2010/04/reading-icon.png" alt="reading icon" width="80" height="104" /></a></strong>

<strong>Read Bereiter &amp; Scardamalia (2006) for a discussion of the three waves of ICT in education. </strong>(See "Recommended Readings &amp; Resources" below.)<strong>
</strong>
#### E-Learning as Learning 2.0
For another perspective, we direct you to an article written by Gerri Sinclair, Milt McClaren and Michael Griffin: <em>E-Learning and Beyond</em>. This article was written as a think piece in support of the Campus 2020 planning process that the Ministry of Advanced Education British Columbia organized in 2006. Sinclair et al. propose what is probably the most radical conception of e-learning. In many ways it is anti-institutional and learner centered in the most extreme sense. Their idea is that the Web 2.0 collaboration and networking technologies allow learners to manage and direct their own learning. Their perspective is framed around the notion of moving from an architecture of presentation to an architecture of participation from web 1.0 to web 2.0 and learning 1.0 to learning 2.0. In Appendix 2 of their article they present a list of institutional e-learning readiness criteria which we will refer to later in the course.

<strong><a href="http://blogs.ubc.ca/etec5202015/files/2010/04/reading-icon.png"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-3032" src="http://blogs.ubc.ca/etec5202015/files/2010/04/reading-icon.png" alt="reading icon" width="80" height="104" /></a></strong>

<strong>In addition to reading the Sinclair et al. article, we recommend you read a critique of it by the Confederation of University Faculty Associations: <em>Putting Learning Before Technology. </em></strong>(See "Recommended Readings &amp; Resources" below.)<strong><strong>
</strong></strong>
#### E-Learning and Open Education
The final perspective to consider in thinking about what e-learning means, comes from the growing open education (OE) movement. According to its proponents, OE has the potential to radically change education by promoting and facilitating the sharing and reuse of educational resources and pedagogical practices and by making this all freely available to anybody who has Internet access. According to Baraniuk (2008) the OE movement is based on the idea that "knowledge should be free and open to use and reuse; that collaboration should be easier, not harder; that people should receive credit and kudos for contributing to education and research; and that concepts and ideas are linked in unusual and surprising ways and not in the simple linear forms that today's textbooks present" (p. 229).

In many ways the notion of e-learning as open education is philosophically and pedagogically aligned with the perspective offered by Sinclair, McClaren and Griffin in the E-Learning and Beyond.

<strong><a href="http://blogs.ubc.ca/etec5202015/files/2010/04/reading-icon.png"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-3032" src="http://blogs.ubc.ca/etec5202015/files/2010/04/reading-icon.png" alt="reading icon" width="80" height="104" /></a>Read <em>Challenges and Opportunities for the Open Education Movement: A Connexions Case Study</em> to get a deeper understanding of what OE is all about.</strong> (See "Recommended Readings &amp; Resources" below.)

You might want to also take a look at some of the videos on open educational resources (OER) in the <strong>Resources</strong> section below.

<strong>The key point we want to make here is that <strong>e-learning can involve a variety of different technologies used in different ways that extend all the way to fully online courses, but it is, by definition, about integrating learning technologies into teaching and learning, not simply using them to enhance existing approaches.</strong> It implies re-thinking and re-designing learning and reorganizing institutions.

#### Questions for Reflection
<ol>
	<li>Do these frameworks help you make sense of the concept of e-learning? Is one framework better than the other?</li>

	<li>If your institution or organization is already using e-learning, where does it fit in these frameworks?</li>
	<li>If your institution or organization is not using e-learning but is planning to use it, where do you think it will fit in these frameworks?</li>
	<li>What do you think of the three distinctive differences between e-learning and distance education identified by Guri-Rosenblit?</li>
	<li>Do you think it makes sense to think of open education as e-learning?</li>
