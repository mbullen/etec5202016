### Overview of the Course <a name="overview-of-the-course"></a>
The purpose of this course is to prepare you to plan and manage e-learning effectively in your institutions and organizations. We will do this through readings and discussions of some of the key issues. The assignments will also give you an opportunity to apply some of these ideas to practical planning activities.

As the title indicates, the course is focused on the use of technology in <strong>higher education</strong> and it is aimed primarily at people with management responsibilities working in this sector or those who aspire to work as educational managers. If you don't fit this profile, you can still benefit from this course but you might have to work a bit harder to make sense of some of material and concepts.
#### Terminology
As you begin working through the course you will notice that we use a number of different terms somewhat interchangeably: e-Learning, learning technology, educational technology, online learning and so on. This is perhaps a bit sloppy because these aren't synonyms, but then there aren't any clear and commonly-accepted definitions of the many terms that are used to describe the use of technology in teaching and learning. In practice you will find teachers, instructors and administrators using these and other terms, often to mean different things. This is a problem with our field. We do try to clarify the terminology issue in Unit 1 when we discuss the meaning of e-learning.
#### Evolving Thinking About Planning for E-Learning

My thinking about how to plan effectively for e-learning has evolved over the 12 years that I have been involved in this course. And it has evolved along with my career as I moved from a relatively marginal, but central, Distance Education support unit in a research-intensive university (UBC) to a much larger, more diverse and central Learning &amp; Teaching support unit at a large technical institute (BCIT) to an intergovernmental agency (Commonwealth of Learning) where I provide support to higher education institutions around the world.

When I started teaching this course, I subscribed wholeheartedly to the view that the effective use of e-learning in higher education required central planning and central support. In fact, this is the point a I make quite strongly in the chapter, <em>Revisiting the Need for Strategic Planning for e-Learning in Higher Education</em>. Ideally there would be an e-learning strategy that was linked to the larger institutional strategic plan and each school or faculty would have its own strategy for e-learning that flowed from the institutional strategy. Institutions would support their e-learning strategy by establishing (if they didn't already exist) central support units to provide instructional design, media production, faculty development, and technical support. I considered the more grassroots and ground-up approaches that were driven by individual faculty as early stages in the development and maturation of the institution's approach to e-learning. Ultimately, I believed, if an institution wanted to be serious about e-learning it would progress from this to a more planned and strategic approach. But, I no longer believe that. Or at least, I no longer believe that this necessarily the approach that all higher education institutions should be striving for. My experience working in and with different institutions has led me to the conclusion that strategic planning for e-learning may not be necessary in all cases and may not produce the results that proponents think it will. I have seen far too many examples of strategic plans that don't get implemented and too many examples of innovative e-learning happening in the absence of a strategic plan. Now I'm not suggesting that we should abandon planning altogether. I am not advocating a wild west approach where everybody does his or her own thing. What I am suggesting is that we need to be much more flexible in our thinking about this and accept that different contexts demand different approaches. A large mega-university such as the Indira Ghandi National Open University in India with 4 million students is going to require a much different approach to planning and managing e-learning than a small liberal arts institution like Amherst College in the United States with only 1,800 students.

I will have more to say about this later in the course and in our discussions but I wanted to raise this issue at the outset because I think you will find there is a very strong bias in favour of the centrally-planned approach to e-learning in many of the readings. Certainly the main text by Bates &amp; Sangrà makes a strong case for this approach. I don't think we should be rejecting this approach but we do need to be much more mindful of the contexts in which we are working.

My hope is that as you work through this course you will develop your own perspective on this issue and determine what you think is the best approach for the context in which you work. Regardless of the approach we adopt, institutions need to be ready for e-learning and this course is primarily about institutional readiness for e-learning and attempts to answer the question, what are the key factors that are needed in order to effectively implement e-learning in a higher education institution?
#### Course Content

The course content is divided into six units:

<strong>Unit 1- Understanding E-Learning</strong> provides an introduction to the concept of e-learning, what it means, the rationales for using it, and an overview of some of the current and emerging technologies and the implications for teaching and learning.

<strong>Unit 2 - Getting Ready for E-Learning  </strong>serves as an overview of the course by introducing the key readiness issues of organizational structure, planning, funding, IT infrastructure, faculty readiness, learner readiness and organizational culture. Each of these issues is covered in more detail in subsequent units.

<strong>Unit 3 - Organizing for E-Learning: Models of Organization </strong>examines various ways in which e-learning can be organized in higher education institutions. These include centralized and decentralized models, and "Do it Yourself" approaches.

<strong>Unit 4 - Organizing for E-Learning: Institutional Organization and Governance</strong> continues the focus on the organization of e-learning but with an emphasis on where e-learning fits in the organizational structure and hierarchy and how it is governed at an institutional level. Various funding models are also covered in Unit 4.

<strong>Unit 5 - Planning for E-Learning </strong>looks at institutional planning for e-learning and the strategic planning process as well as government planning and policy as it affects e-learning.

<strong>Unit 6 - Implementing E-Learning</strong> discusses different approaches to course and program development, learner and faculty support issues and faculty development.
#### Background to the Course

This course was originally developed by Tony Bates for the graduate certificate in Technology-based Distributed Learning (TBDL) that was offered by the UBC Distance Education &amp; Technology department from 1997-2002. The course was revised  in 2002 when the TBDL  was turned into the Master of Educational Technology and taken over by the Faculty of Education. Then in 2003 Mark Bullen took over responsibility for the course and made further revisions. Since then the course has been revised and updated on an annual basis. In 2014 Mark Bullen completed a major revision to the course.
### Learning Outcomes <a name="learning-outcomes"></a>
Upon successful completion of this course we expect you will be able to:
<ol>
	<li>Discuss the different meanings of e-learning.</li>
	<li>Discuss and critique the key rationales for using e-learning in higher education.</li>
	<li>Analyze different approaches to planning and supporting e-learning in higher education.</li>
	<li>Determine the appropriate approach to planning and supporting e-learning in your institution or organization.</li>
	<li>Develop an appropriate strategy for planning and managing e-learning in our institution or organization;</li>
	<li>Discuss some of the social, economic and political factors that are influencing the planning and management of e-learning in higher education;</li>
	<li>Discuss the key principles of the open education movement and how they might be integrated into institutional planning for e-learning.</li>
</ol>

### Teaching & Learning Approach <a name="teaching-&-learning-approach"></a>
There are no right and wrong answers to the questions about how to effectively plan and manage e-learning. While there is some basic knowledge you need to have about planning and managing e-learning in higher education, this course is about ideas and issues that are influenced by personal values, ideologies, and world views and it is based primarily on the experience of the course authors, and on reports and articles by managers from other institutions with fairly recent experience of planning and managing e-learning in higher education.  Many of you will have other, equally relevant experiences, and we want to be able to draw on, share and discuss this varied set of experiences.

Our aim then is not to pontificate but to direct you to sources of information and to perspectives you may not have considered. It will be up to you to decide what is most relevant and appropriate to you and your situation. This means you will need to use your information seeking, analysis and interpretation skills, and be ready and willing to critique the planning and management examples that you will read about.

We aim to prepare you for this in the following ways:
<ol>
	<li>by providing you with different perspectives on planning and managing e-learning in higher education;</li>
	<li>by providing you with an introduction to some basic principles and ideas of planning and management in this field, such as visioning, resource allocation, project management, etc.;</li>
	<li>by providing you with analytical frameworks that will get you started in critiquing different approaches to planning and management in this field;</li>
	<li>by helping you to find your own references and sources of information on research in this field, and by helping you assess the value of the information you collect;</li>
	<li>through discussion groups and assignments to analyze and evaluate what you have learned;</li>
	<li>by getting you to reflect on your own views, and to step back from these to understand some of your own underlying, and possibly unquestioned, assumptions;</li>
	<li>by having you work collaboratively with other students through the discussion groups and assignments, in order to get a wider range of perspectives on the various issues that arise in this course.</li>
</ol>

### Readings & Resources <a name="readings-&-resources"></a>
There are two textbooks for this course and a number online readings and resources.

The readings that are listed as "Recommended" are the core readings for the course. The readings that are listed as "Additional" are references you may want to pursue depending on your particular interests. They will allow you explore certain topics in more detail.

There are far too many readings and resources in this course for you to possibly read them all in the time allocated. This means you will need to be very selective in what you choose to read in depth. We suggest that you follow the guidelines on the Web site for each unit, that you cover the recommended readings, participate actively in the discussion forums, then use whatever remaining time you have on some of the other readings and resources, allowing time, of course, to do your assignments. Time management then is going to be important.

We have tried to provide a varied selection of readings in recognition of the fact you will have different interests. Our aim is also to provide resources that may be useful to you after you have finished the formal study of this course, as well as during the course.

### Resources & Support <a name="resources-&-support"></a>
#### Library Services

All MET students have access to the full resources and support of the UBC library. The UBC library has extensive online resources such as research journals, databases and full-text resources. As well, you have limited access to print-based document delivery of materials that are not available online, but which are held by the library. This access will enable you to greatly extend the depth of your research in all of your MET courses.

Once again, we wish to emphasize that with so many resources available to you, you will need to use them <strong>selectively</strong>. We suggest that you follow the guidelines on the Web site for each unit, that you cover the required readings, participate actively in the discussion forums, then use whatever remaining time you have on some of the other readings and resources, allowing time, of course, to do your assignments. <strong>Time managemen</strong>t then is going to be important.
#### Technical Support
If you are having problems accessing the course website or using some of its tools or features, you should contact the <a href="http://support.olt.ubc.ca/de/" target="_blank">CTLT Help Desk</a> (also on the menu on the right).
#### Other Resources
<a href="http://delicious.com/" target="_blank">Delicious social bookmarking</a><br>

<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0klgLsSxGsU" target="_blank">Introductory Video on RSS</a>

You do need to familiarize yourself with how to use this environment, so take a few minutes to move around the course and try out various links or tools. If you need help with any feature, click on Help at the top of this page.

### Workload and General Guidelines <a name="workload"></a>
#### Studying this Course
This is a graduate course aimed primarily at people working in the postsecondary education system. We therefore expect you to be able to <strong>seek out, analyze, and evaluate information</strong> for yourself, and to be able to draw critically on your own experience and reflect on that in the light of the material presented in this course.

We also expect you to share your findings, your perspectives and your experiences with each other through the group work and the online discussion activities. We hope that by #### Workload
Although we will provide you with as much help as we can, do not expect this to be an easy course. You should budget an average of between <strong><span style="color: #000000">eight to twelve hours a week</span></strong> for study; some of you will need even longer, depending how actively you participate in the discussions and the amount of independent research you do on the issues. Twelve hours a week should allow you to cover the course thoroughly. You may of course not have this much time to spare, but you should be able to cover the minimum required within eight to ten hours a week.

Whether or not English is your first language, you will need to be very skilled in reading quickly and selectively, and in writing clearly and succinctly, in English.

You will be asked to think for yourself, to make difficult choices, to work collaboratively with other students, and to have your ideas and views criticized publicly by others. You will be asked to do a lot of work on your own. In particular, you will be asked to find out information for yourself, to analyze the information, and to make decisions based on your analysis.
#### General Guidelines for Studying this Course
<ol>
	<li>Read those readings designated <strong>required</strong>. You should only read the <strong>additional</strong> readings if you are interested in pursuing a particular topic in more depth. You do not need to read the additional readings to successfully complete the course.</li>
	<li>Participate regularly and actively in the discussion forums. You will receive instructions about the current discussions from your instructor. Make sure you read the <a href="http://blogs.ubc.ca/etec520archive/about-2/course-web-site-and-discussion-forums/" target="_blank"><strong>Discussion Forum Guidelines</strong> </a>in the <strong>Introduction </strong>section.</li>
	<li><strong>Leave yourself enough time to do the assignments.</strong> There are three challenging assignments in this course, so don't delay getting started. Don't be afraid to use the discussion forums or email to contact your instructor or other students to test ideas, ask questions, seek other Web sites, etc. We strongly encourage collaboration in this course.</li>
</ol>
### Navigating The Course <a name="test"></a>
The main purpose of this course web site is to provide you with a structured pathway through the course content and to provide you with all the administrative and logistical information you need to complete the course. We will also highlight key issues and introduce some of our thoughts on these issues.  In addition, we have integrated a number of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rss" target="_blank">RSS feeds</a> that will allow for new content and resources to be added dynamically. These feeds are in the right-hand menu and they provide links to new online resources.

The course Web site contains a number of components. You can access these from the Navigation bar on the top of each page and on the right-hand side of each page. At the top of the page you will find the tabs, <strong>Home, Introduction, and Unit 1-6</strong>. When you click on a Unit tab in the top navigation bar you'll see a list of the pages in that unit. The page you are on should be highlighted.

The <strong>Home</strong> page is a blog page which I will update periodically with new postings on relevant topics.

In the right-hand navigation frame you will find links to various <strong>Course Resources</strong>, a list of links to various <strong>Internet Resources</strong> and an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rss" target="_blank">RSS feed</a> of bookmarks that have been tagged with "Planning_Ed_Tech".  To go to one of these, just click on it and the relevant page will appear. Note that some of these will take you outside the Word Press site to the Blackboard Connect website or to other websites.
#### Course Content
The course content is contained in six units. You access this by clicking on the <strong>Unit </strong>link in the top navigation bar which will display drop down menu of the pages in the Unit. Each unit contains some direct teaching information, learning activities, and directions to other resources.
#### Reading Off Line
You can download all the material on the Word Press site for offline reading simply by clicking on the printer icon in the right hand frame. This will generate a printer friendly version of the page you are on which you can either print out or save to your desktop.
#### Resources
When you go to the <strong>Resources &amp; Support</strong> page (click the <strong>Resources &amp; Support</strong> link under <strong>Course Resources</strong> on the right-hand side of the page), you will find a number of different features available to you:
<ul>
	<li>Readings</li>
	<li>Discussion forum guidelines</li>
	<li>MET library services</li>
	<li>ACCULT</li>
	<li>Using quotations appropriately</li>
	<li>UBC ACCULT video scenario</li>
</ul>
You can see that you should have plenty of resources at your disposal for this course. Your main challenge will be to focus your searches on the most useful sources for the particular activities and assignments you are set, and to collect and organize that information in a clear and easy to use manner.
#### Social Bookmarking
<a href="http://blogs.ubc.ca/etec5202015/files/2010/04/diigo.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-588 alignleft" style="margin: 5px; border: 0pt none;" src="http://blogs.ubc.ca/etec520/files/2010/04/delicious_logo.png" alt="delicious_logo" width="121" height="121" /><img class="alignlright wp-image-2948" src="http://blogs.ubc.ca/etec5202015/files/2010/04/diigo.jpg" alt="" width="124" height="124" /></a>

We strongly recommend that you use a social bookmarking tool to save URLs of interest. Until recently I was using <a href="//del.icio.us/','new_frame','width=600,height=420,menubar=1,toolbar=1,scrollbars=1,status=1,location=1,resizable=1',0)">Delicious</a>  but it providea little or no support and its RSS functionality is always breaking so I switched to  <a href="http://www.diigo.com" target="_blank">Diigo.</a> These tools allows you to bookmark and share resources and see what  other people who are interested in the same topics are bookmarking. It provides you with easy access to additional resources of interest (see for example the resources tagged ‘elearning’) as well as an idea of their popularity and thus possibly importance/ usefulness.

What you will need to do:
<ol>
	<li>Go to <a href="http://delicious.com" target="_blank">Delicious</a> or <a href="http://www.diigo.com" target="_blank">Diigo</a>.</li>
	<li>Create an account for yourself if you don’t already have one. Remember, this can be something you can take away and use long after the course is over.  You may want to include other URLs of interest to you, or you may already have an account you can use.</li>
	<li>Tag all items of interest to this course with <strong>Planning_Ed_Tech</strong> so that others may easily retrieve the resources and share their own.</li>
</ol>
You can read more about social bookmarking in the following article:
<a href="http://wiki.ubc.ca/Documentation:Social_Bookmarking/Elearning" target="_blank">Social Bookmarking</a>

I have been tagging resources for this course since I started teaching it in 2003 and I have added an RSS feed for these resources in the right-hand column with items tagged with <strong>Planning_Ed_Tech</strong>. I will update this during the course as I come across items that I think are relevant and interesting.

### Instructor Communication <a name="communication"></a>
Most of the communication in this course will take place through through the UBC Connect discussion forums and Connect e-mail. Your instructor may also use regular e-mail to communicate with you on occasion. If you would prefer not to be contacted by regular e-mail, please let your instructor know.

Your instructor will be available for help and support on an individual basis. You can contact your instructor by e-mail and you can make arrangements to talk by phone if needed. We aim to respond to <strong>e-mails</strong> <strong>within one working day</strong>, although occasionally, particularly if your instructor is traveling, this may not always be possible.

Your instructor will also moderate the unit discussion forums, and will mark your assignments. We aim to provide a grade and detailed feedback on assignments<strong> within 10 working days</strong>. Please do not hesitate to contact your instructor if you have any problems or concerns. <strong>Note, however,  that your instructor may not be available on weekends or holidays.</strong>
#### Getting to Know Your Instructor
You can read a brief biography of your instructor by following the link below.

<a href="http://localhost:8888/grav-skeleton-course-hub-site/instructor-bios" target="_blank">Instructor Bios</a>

### Activities <a name="activities"></a>
#### Exploring the Resources
<ol>
	<li>Spend some time browsing the various sources listed in <em>Resources</em>.</li>
	<li>If you find articles or references that you think might be particularly useful for this course, add the URL to your bookmarks.</li>
	<li>You may also want to keep a notebook of useful references that you find when browsing, for future use.</li>
	<li>You may want to develop your own category system, based on the topics these readings seem to cover.</li>
</ol>
#### Exploring the Readings
The aim of this activity is to familiarize yourself with the readings.
<ol>
	<li>Quickly skim through the list of contents of the text books and the online readings, noting the titles of the different chapters, articles and papers.</li>
	<li>If you have time, quickly skim through those chapters and articles that have abstracts, and read the abstracts. For those that don't have abstracts, read the introduction and/or conclusions.</li>
</ol>
You should read the print and online articles in two different ways: when you are specifically directed to them in an activity or assignment; and when you are looking for appropriate sources for an activity, and believe that this article provides useful information, even though it may not have been cited within the course.

Be careful in using these articles and any information you find from the Internet. You may quote from them (or any other articles you find useful) in assignments and projects, but the quotation should be reasonably short, and should be fully referenced. Quotes should be used very sparingly and only when they clearly add value to your paper my making a point in a way that you could not do just as well in your own words. (See the article on the use of quotations in the Resources section.) In most cases, you should re-word or paraphrase comments and ideas from articles, but again be sure to attribute them accurately through a reference. Remember: your instructor has also read these articles and will recognize any unattributed use.

### Conclusion <a name="conclusion"></a>
This is an ambitious course. It examines institutional readiness for e-learning and touches on issues and strategies at several different levels: course, program, institutional and government/system.  We have done this because decisions made at one level inevitably have an influence on decisions at other levels. You will need to be quite focused in your work. We have tried to divide the course so that the majority of it is concerned with institutional readiness, planning and implementation, but these need to be embedded in a wider context. Our advice is to continue to relate the course to your own context, while keeping an eye on planning and management in other contexts. We also advise you to try to keep on schedule, moving from one unit to another on the due dates. You should also use the assignment questions and marking criteria as guidelines on where to focus as you work through the material.

Lastly we would like to re-iterate the point that there are no well established principles or guidelines on planning and managing e-learning and learning technologies that you can safely follow in a systematic or well defined manner. You will need to remain flexible and open to a variety of approaches. What we have tried to do in this course is to make you more aware of the issues, and some possible alternatives and strategies for dealing with these issues. There is however plenty of scope for your own solutions and ideas, based on your experience, and we encourage you to share these with your fellow participants on this course.

If you have got this far, and have done as many of the activities as you intend to do, then you are now ready to start Unit 1. Just click on the <strong>Unit 1 </strong>tab on the top navigation bar.

We hope you enjoy this course!
