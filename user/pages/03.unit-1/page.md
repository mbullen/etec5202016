In this unit we focus on three main topics:
<ol>
	<li>The different ways in which e-learning has been defined;</li>
	<li>The different rationales that organization and institutions have for using e-learning;</li>
	<li>The implications of using e-learning for teaching and learning.</li>
</ol>
I am not going to suggest that there is one correct definition of e-learning but rather that we need to recognize that the term means different things to different people. The important thing is to develop a common understanding with the people we work with and not assume that everybody has the same understanding.

Just as important is to recognize that there can be a variety of different rationales for using e-learning. Again, there is no correct rationale, although an argument can be made that some are better than others. The main point is that to plan effectively for e-learning we need to be clear about why we are proposing to use it and what we mean by the term.

#### Reading Tips
Read selectively and learn to skim over materials that are not directly relevant for the part of the assignment you are tackling at the moment, (although they may turn out to be useful later). We have indicated key pages - if you find them interesting/relevant, you may want to read the whole chapter/article. But plan your time.

Also, note that these readings are not listed in order of priority, although we have tried to indicate the more relevant sections.

You are now almost ready to start looking at planning and management issues in some detail. However first we want to briefly define the term, e-learning and discuss the impact it is having on teaching, so that the context in which planning and managing take place is fully understood.

### Key Points <a name="keypoints"></a>
There are four key points we would like you take away from this unit.

1. The Meaning of E-Learning<br>
First, it is important to develop a clear understanding of the concept of e-learning and ensure that when you are discussing it with colleagues that you are talking about the same thing. As you will see later in this unit, everybody seems to be talking about e-learning these days but finding two people who have the same understanding of the concept is a challenge. As mentioned earlier, we do not want to suggest there is a correct and an incorrect understanding of the concept, the important thing is that you clarify your understanding and recognize that others may be using the term to mean something quite different.<p>
How we understand the concept has important implications for how we organize our institutions to develop and support e-learning, for the kind support we provide learners and faculty, for how it is funded, how it relates to the mission and goals of the institution, and for the kind of organizational structures we put in place to support e-learning.<p>
As you will see later in the unit, we find it useful to think about e-learning as a continuum ranging from technology support for classroom teaching at one end to fully online distance education at the other. We also find the categories of e-learning proposed by Massy &amp; Zemsky (2004) useful:
* e-learning as distance education
* e-learning as facilitated transaction software
* e-learning as electronically-mediated learning<p>

2. Reasons for Using E-Learning<br>
Equally important as understanding the meaning of e-learning is being clear about why you want to use it. It is easy to get swept up in the the techno-utopic frenzy to be on the leading edge but you should be using e-learning to achieve some clear goals. Improving the quality of teaching and learning, broadening access, reaching new markets, cost savings, doing more with the same, are the key reasons that institutions usually turn to e-learning. You need to be sure that your reasons for using e-learning are clear and, ideally, consistent with your institution's goals for e-learning.

3. Implications for Teaching & Learning<br>
If e-learning is to be used effectively to increase access, improve quality and make higher education more cost-effective, we believe significant changes will be needed to how our institutions are organized. Without major changes to how programs are designed and delivered, adding technology to the mix will only add costs and will likely do little to address quality and access issues. Key to addressing access and costs is redesigning teaching so that different technologies and modes of delivery are exploited appropriately. Thus, in our view, e-learning is more than just enhancing teaching with technology. It implies<strong> re-thinking and re-designing learning and reorganizing institutions. It is, by definition, about integrating learning technologies into teaching and learning, not simply using them to enhance existing approaches.</strong>

### 1.1 What is E-Learning <a name="elearning"></a>
<a href="http://blogs.ubc.ca/etec5202015/files/2011/08/hourglass-icon1-e1403212651814.jpg"><img class="alignleft wp-image-3038 size-full" src="http://blogs.ubc.ca/etec5202015/files/2011/08/hourglass-icon1-e1403212651814.jpg" alt="" width="55" height="55" /></a>
We recommend that you spend about <strong>two</strong> hours on this section.
<p style="text-align: left;">One of the problems with discussing eLearning is that there are so many different understandings of the concept. Even in the literature you will find it used and defined differently by different authors. It is essential, then, that we begin with a common understanding, or at least acknowledge there are different understandings.</p>
The following video summarizes the commentary that follows.
<p style="text-align: center;"><iframe src="//player.vimeo.com/video/100808160" width="500" height="281" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>

#### The eLearning Continuum
In figure 1 we present one way of thinking about e-learning. E-learning is part of a teaching and learning continuum that begins with face-to-face teaching <strong>without</strong> the use of information and communication technologies (ICT) at one end and fully online distance learning at the other end.
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://blogs.ubc.ca/etec520/files/2010/04/eLearning-graphic-1.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-large wp-image-2441" title="eLearning graphic-1" src="http://blogs.ubc.ca/etec520/files/2010/04/eLearning-graphic-1-1024x422.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="263" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Figure 1 -The eLearning Continuum</p>
 As we move along the continuum from fully face-to-face teaching, technology is used to replace the face-to-face elements. Initially, this has very little impact on how teaching is organized and how learning occurs because the technology is used primarily to enhance the face-to-face teaching. But as we move further along the continuum, the nature of teaching and how it is organized is increasingly affected by the use of ICT. Somewhere around the middle of the continuum we have what is called blended learning.

In a blended environment, fewer face-to-face sessions are held as technology is used increasingly to deliver the teaching and to facilitate the learning. And nature of the face-to-face sessions changes. Instead of coming to class to listen to a teacher, students come to discuss, and to work and collaborate in small groups. Once we reach the right end of the continuum there is no longer any face-to-face teaching and we have fully online learning in which all teaching is technology-mediated.

<strong>E-learning is that part of the continuum that begins when technology is used to replace some of the face-to-face teaching to the point on the continuum where it replaces it all.</strong>

It's also important to understand the relationship between e-learning and distance education. These days distance education is increasingly delivered online but historically it has used other technologies and there is still a considerable amount of distance education that would not be considered e-learning. So, we can have what we call blended e-learning in which there is a combination of face-to-face and technology-mediated teaching or distance education e-learning in which all teaching and learning is done without teacher and learners ever meeting face-to-face. And there can be distance education that is primarily print-based and would not be considered e-learning.

#### Three Types of E-Learning
<a href="http://www.thelearningalliance.info/WeatherStation.html" target="_blank">Zemsky &amp; Massy (2004) </a>have proposed what we consider to be quite useful framework for understanding e-learning because it allows us to capture a diversity of understandings of the concept in three fairly easy to understand categories.

The three categories are:
1. E-learning as distance education</li>
2. E-learning as facilitated transactions software</li>
3. E-learning as electronically-mediated learning</li>
<strong><a href="http://blogs.ubc.ca/etec5202015/files/2010/04/reading-icon.png"><img class="alignleft wp-image-3032 size-full" src="http://blogs.ubc.ca/etec5202015/files/2010/04/reading-icon.png" alt="reading icon" width="80" height="104" /></a></strong><br>
<strong>Read Zemsky &amp; Massy (2004) for a the details of this framework. (See "Recommended Readings &amp; Resources" below.)</strong>

#### Three Waves of ICT
Carl Bereiter and Marlene Scardamalia offer another framework that looks at the use of information and communication technologies (ICT) in education and suggests it is helpful to think of it happening in three waves. Although they use the term ICT, we think their framework can be used to understand how e-learning has diffused through our higher education system.

Wave 1: Technology as imperative. Computers (and e-learning) were seen as essential to the preparation of our students for the information age.

Wave 2: In the second wave, the focus shifted to using computers (and e-learning) in appropriate ways. It was no longer technology for technology's sake but "pedagogy before technology".

Wave 3: ICTs as affordances. In the third wave, the focus, according to Berieter and Scardamalia is where it should be: on the educational ideas. It is not so much about integrating technology into educational activities as it is about understanding the potential of various technologies and and designing educational activities that take this into account. The difference between wave 2 and wave 3 is subtle and we suggest you read the Berieter and Scardamallia article to gain a better understanding.

<strong><a href="http://blogs.ubc.ca/etec5202015/files/2010/04/reading-icon.png"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-3032" src="http://blogs.ubc.ca/etec5202015/files/2010/04/reading-icon.png" alt="reading icon" width="80" height="104" /></a></strong><br>
<strong>Read Bereiter &amp; Scardamalia (2006) for a discussion of the three waves of ICT in education. </strong>(See "Recommended Readings &amp; Resources" below.)
#### E-Learning as Learning 2.0
For another perspective, we direct you to an article written by Gerri Sinclair, Milt McClaren and Michael Griffin: <em>E-Learning and Beyond</em>. This article was written as a think piece in support of the Campus 2020 planning process that the Ministry of Advanced Education British Columbia organized in 2006. Sinclair et al. propose what is probably the most radical conception of e-learning. In many ways it is anti-institutional and learner centered in the most extreme sense. Their idea is that the Web 2.0 collaboration and networking technologies allow learners to manage and direct their own learning. Their perspective is framed around the notion of moving from an architecture of presentation to an architecture of participation from web 1.0 to web 2.0 and learning 1.0 to learning 2.0. In Appendix 2 of their article they present a list of institutional e-learning readiness criteria which we will refer to later in the course.

<strong><a href="http://blogs.ubc.ca/etec5202015/files/2010/04/reading-icon.png"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-3032" src="http://blogs.ubc.ca/etec5202015/files/2010/04/reading-icon.png" alt="reading icon" width="80" height="104" /></a></strong><br>
<strong>In addition to reading the Sinclair et al. article, we recommend you read a critique of it by the Confederation of University Faculty Associations: <em>Putting Learning Before Technology. </em></strong>(See "Recommended Readings &amp; Resources" below.)<strong><strong>
</strong></strong>
#### E-Learning and Open Education
The final perspective to consider in thinking about what e-learning means, comes from the growing open education (OE) movement. According to its proponents, OE has the potential to radically change education by promoting and facilitating the sharing and reuse of educational resources and pedagogical practices and by making this all freely available to anybody who has Internet access. According to Baraniuk (2008) the OE movement is based on the idea that "knowledge should be free and open to use and reuse; that collaboration should be easier, not harder; that people should receive credit and kudos for contributing to education and research; and that concepts and ideas are linked in unusual and surprising ways and not in the simple linear forms that today's textbooks present" (p. 229).

In many ways the notion of e-learning as open education is philosophically and pedagogically aligned with the perspective offered by Sinclair, McClaren and Griffin in the E-Learning and Beyond.

<strong><a href="http://blogs.ubc.ca/etec5202015/files/2010/04/reading-icon.png"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-3032" src="http://blogs.ubc.ca/etec5202015/files/2010/04/reading-icon.png" alt="reading icon" width="80" height="104" /></a><br>
Read <em>Challenges and Opportunities for the Open Education Movement: A Connexions Case Study</em> to get a deeper understanding of what OE is all about.</strong> (See "Recommended Readings &amp; Resources" below.)

You might want to also take a look at some of the videos on open educational resources (OER) in the <strong>Resources</strong> section below.

<strong>The key point we want to make here is that <strong>e-learning can involve a variety of different technologies used in different ways that extend all the way to fully online courses, but it is, by definition, about integrating learning technologies into teaching and learning, not simply using them to enhance existing approaches.</strong> It implies re-thinking and re-designing learning and reorganizing institutions.

### 1.2 Rationales for E-Learning <a name="rationales"></a>
<a href="http://blogs.ubc.ca/etec5202015/files/2011/08/hourglass-icon1-e1403212651814.jpg"><img class="alignleft wp-image-3038 size-full" src="http://blogs.ubc.ca/etec5202015/files/2011/08/hourglass-icon1-e1403212651814.jpg" alt="hourglass icon" width="55" height="55" /></a>
We recommend you spend about <strong>2-4 hours</strong> on the readings and activities in this section.

Bates &amp; Sangr√† propose five key reasons for using e-learning in higher education:
<ol>
	<li>To enhance the quality of teaching &amp; learning</li>
	<li>To accommodate to the learning style of Millennials</li>
	<li>To increase access to learning opportunities and to increase flexibility for students</li>
	<li>To develop the skill and competencies needed in the 21st Century</li>
	<li>To Improve cost-effectiveness</li>
</ol>
<em><strong><a href="http://blogs.ubc.ca/etec5202015/files/2010/04/reading-icon.png"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-3032" src="http://blogs.ubc.ca/etec5202015/files/2010/04/reading-icon.png" alt="reading icon" width="80" height="104" /></a></strong></em>
Read Chapter 1 of Bates &amp; Sangr√† for a detailed discussion of these key reasons. Then continue reading this commentary.
#### Critique of Reasons for Using E-Learning
While it is important to have a clear and well-supported rationale for using e-learning, it is equally important that we critically examine the most commonly proposed reasons which Bates &amp; Sangr√† discuss in Chapter 1 of their book. Improving access and flexibility, and enhancing quality are the least contentious of the five reasons they put forward and I have no problem with these. There is little doubt, in my view, that we can make education more accessible through the use of e-learning by reducing or eliminating the need for real-time attendance at schools and colleges. This makes it easier for people who are working full-time or who live in remote locations to pursue an education. As for enhancing the quality of education, Bates &amp; Sangr√† make a strong case for how e-learning can do this and I agree with them. They also make the point that we need to go beyond simply enhancing and move towards transforming and I think this is a key point. It also relates to the cost-effectiveness rationale. As Bates &amp; Sangr√† point out, if all we do is add technology to existing approaches, we may well enhance quality but we will also be increasing costs. The only way to achieve cost effectiveness is if we change our approaches and use e-learning to replace current activities and the only way to transform teaching and learning is to use e-learning to move away from a teacher-centered, transmission model of education.

The two reasons put forward by Bates &amp; Sangr√† that I think we need to take a critical look at are the ones that deal with millennial learning styles and 21st century skills.
#### The Millennials Learning Style Argument
<p style="text-align: left;">This is the weakest argument put forward by Bates &amp; Sangr√† and really shouldn't even be included in their discussion of reasons. As they correctly point out, there is no empirical support for the argument that Millennial students have inherently different needs or learning styles than other students. In fact, the whole notion of <a href="http://www.changemag.org/Archives/Back%20Issues/September-October%202010/the-myth-of-learning-full.html" target="_blank">learning styles itself is empirically weak</a>. That really should be end of the discussion but it isn't and by devoting as much space to this proposition as they do, they end up giving it a certain amount of undeserved legitimacy.</p>
In fact, there is no credible evidence to support the argument that there is a generational basis for using e-learning. We should be making decisions based on the needs of the learners we have in our class, not a stereotype. Watch this short video for a summary of the key reasons we should be skeptical of this argument.

#### The 21st Century Skills Argument
Bates &amp; Sangra talk about the growth of knowledge-based companies and how these differ from typical industrial businesses and require workers with different skills, but the examples given are almost always technology companies. What percentage of the workforce is employed in this sector? Do we exaggerate the importance of the knowledge sector? My concern with this argument is that it assumes that everybody will need to be a "knowledge worker" in the 21st century when, in fact, there is evidence a significant part of the knowledge economy workforce doesn't need these so-called 21st century skills (see Brown et al. 2011). As Selwyn (2013) notes, <em>"At best, most of the 'informational' jobs of the twenty-first-century would seem to be centred around technology-based divisions of labour where most workers are no longer expected to exercise independent judgement or contribute creatively to the value-adding process"</em> (p. 153). Think of the thousands of people working in Amazon's warehouses or call-centre workers around the world.

Even if we accept the argument that these skills are needed, there are still questions about whether using e-learning contributes to their development. Here there seems to be a confusion between using the technology as a platform for teaching and learning and using the technology for purposes other than formal learning, e.g., finding and evaluating information, communication, networking etc. It is quite possible to use e-learning to deliver online courses, for example, that make little or no use of the technology in a way that develops these skills. The 21st century skills argument tends to first assume that these skills are needed by all and that by simply using the technology at its simplest level, they will be developed. Furthermore, are these 21st century skills really that different than the 20th century skills? Haven't we always been trying to develop communication and teamwork skills, the ability to learn independently, critical thinking, creativity, and social skills?

So it's important to have a good rationale for using e-learning but the rationale must stand up to scrutiny. The Millennial Learning Styles and 21st Century Skills arguments are the most suspect of the five reasons. But even the others: quality, access and cost-effectiveness, must chosen with care. They need to make sense for your institution or organization

</em></strong>Now re-read the articles by Guri-Rosenblit and Sinclair, McClaren and Griffin. Pay particular attention to pp. 478-486 of Guri-Rosenblit which deals with erroneous assumptions about e-learning.

#### Question for Reflection
<ol>
	<li>What do you think of the reasons for using e-learning presented by Bates &amp; Sangr√† and my critique of some of those reasons?</li>
	<li>Do you think the reasons for using e-learning presented by Sinclair et al. are practical and relevant to your context?</li>
	<li>Where is your institution placed within the context discussed by Sinclair et al. ? Is it making moves towards a paradigm shift or is it still very traditional? What criteria could you use to measure the degree of 'movement'?</li>
	<li>What is your view of Guri-Rosenblit's claim that most of the sweeping predictions about e-learning are based on some erroneous assumptions?</li>

### Overview of Learning Technologies <a name="learningtechnologies"></a>

<a href="http://blogs.ubc.ca/etec5202015/files/2011/08/hourglass-icon1-e1403212651814.jpg"><img class="alignleft wp-image-3038 size-full" src="http://blogs.ubc.ca/etec5202015/files/2011/08/hourglass-icon1-e1403212651814.jpg" alt="" width="55" height="55" /></a>
<strong>We recommend that you spend 1-2 hours on this section.</strong>

The other courses in the MET deal more extensively with the variety of different educational technologies that are available so we won't go into detail on this topic. An excellent resource that is worth exploring is the <em>Introduction to Learning Technologies</em> course from the University of Saskatchewan listed below in the <strong>Resources</strong> section.

The EDUCAUSE "7 Things You Should Know About..." series is also an excellent source of information on new and emerging technologies and how they can be used to support teaching and learning. See the link below.
<p style="text-align: left;">One of the key points we want to make, however,  is that new tools and technologies are emerging constantly and they are becoming much more accessible to the individual user. There was a time when using educational technology meant you needed to have an educational technology support department and you had to jump through numerous bureaucratic hoops to get the technology in your classroom. The advent of cloud-based software, social media or, more broadly, the notion of Web 2.0, has changed all that. While there are still many technologies that require institutional support, and technical expertise (e.g., learning management systems, videoconferencing), the individual instructor now has access to an amazing variety of technologies that require little or no institutional support. One of the implications of this, in my view, is that we may want to reconsider our use of institutional learning management systems. Watch this brief video for a discussion of this idea.</p>

<strong>Read the EDUCAUSE series, <em>7 Things You Should Know About </em>for some excellent summaries of new and emerging educational technologies</strong>

However, instructors, particularly in Canada, need to be aware of the privacy implications of using many cloud-based software. Freedom of Information legislation in many provinces imposes significant restrictions on using US-based services if students are <strong>required </strong>to use these services to complete their studies. Using these services on an optional basis is a different matter.

### Implications for Teaching and Learning <a name="teachinglearning"></a>
Using e-learning effectively, even at an individual level, has significant implications for how our courses and programs are designed. Access, costs and quality are the main issues we are trying to address in using e-learning but none of these will be adequately addressed if we simply add technology or e-learning to our current way of doing business. E-learning is expensive. There are significant human resource and technology hardware and software costs associated with it. So we need to integrate e-learning, not simply add it to our existing ways of teaching . This means redesigning our teaching so that the affordances of the different technologies and modes of delivery are exploited appropriately.

In this video presentation Dr. Ruben Puentedura explains three models of technology or e-learning integration that will help you understand some of the implications for teaching and learning.

<em><strong>Now read pp. 40-51 of Bates &amp; Sangr√† (2011)  for a discussion of the different modes of e-learning and the relationship between different technologies and different approaches to teaching and learning.</strong></em>

In his latest book, Bates (2014) argues that technology is having a growing impact on the core teaching activities of the university. He suggests there are number of key trends that suggest e-learning is moving from the periphery to the centre. These include the growth in for credit, fully-online learning, growing  use of blended or mixed-mode approaches (more recently called "the flipped classroom"), and growing interest in open learning and MOOCs.

Bates also devotes a large part of chapter 2 of his new book discussing the impact of technology on the nature of knowledge and points to arguments that knowledge is now more of a process than product, the result of the interactions between people rather than the product of individual minds.

#### Trends in Online Learning
<p style="text-align: left;">We end this unit with a presentation from Sir John Daniel, who discusses three trends in online learning:</p>

<ol>
	<li>The shift in online enrollments from public to private post secondary institutions;</li>
	<li>The growing use and acceptance of Open Educational Resources;</li>
	<li>The growth in the use of mobile communications technology.</li>
</ol>

### Conclusion <a name="conclusion"></a>
In this unit we have tried to clarify what the term e-learning means, what are some of the key rationales for using e-learning, and the implications for teaching and learning. We suggest e-learning is best viewed as a continuum of possibilities for increasing the amount technology-mediated learning and that, as this increases, the nature of teaching and learning, and how it is organized and delivered, changes significantly.

While a number of rationlaes for using e-learning have been put forward, addressing quality, access and costs are, in our view, the most important and legitimate reasons for using e-learning. With these reasons in mind, it is essential that we integrate e-learning properly in a way that maximizes the affordances of the different technologies and modes of deliveries. If we don't do this, costs will rise, access will not be increased and quality may not be improved. So we emphasize that <strong>e-learning is more than just enhancing teaching with technology. It implies re-thinking and re-designing learning and reorganizaing institutions. It is, by definition, about integrating learning technologies into teaching and learning, not simply using them to enhance existing approaches.</strong>

The use of e-learning opens up completely new possibilities for teaching, but institutions need to be ready to make significant changes if the potential of e-learning is to be fully exploited. In the next unit we begin to examine institutional readiness, particularly planning, governance and organizational culture issues.
