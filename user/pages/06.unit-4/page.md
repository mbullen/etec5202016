### Introduction  

In this unit, we focus on institutional planning for e-learning. Appropriate planning is essential to the sustainable and cost-effective implementation of large-scale e-learning in higher education. However, as mentioned earlier, it is not a necessary precondition for all e-learning. It all depends on the context and the scale of the implementation. In many cases, more ground-up approaches may be appropriate such seeding and promoting innovation by providing individual professors with incentives to experiment with e-learning. However, when organizations decide to make e-learning a core part of their business and implement it on a large scale, strategic planning for e-learning is essential. This means the plan must be nested within the institution's overall strategic plan and it must look at the institutional requirements for e-learning and not just those of individual courses, programs or faculties.

In this unit we will look at the components of a strategic plan and the steps in the strategic planning process. There are many different approaches to strategic planning but most have some common characteristics. What we will show you is a fairly generic approach to strategic planning which you will be able to use to develop a strategic plan for e-learning for your own institution.

### Learning Outcomes<a name="outcomes"></a>
After completing this unit you should be able to:
1. Assess the benefits and limitations of strategic planning at an institutional level.
2. Develop a vision for your own institution's use of e-learning.

### Guiding Questions  
Use the following questions to guide your thinking as you study this unit:
1. Is your institution organized in a way that is 'fit-for-purpose', with regard to e-learning? If not, what needs fixing?
2. Using the goals on pp. 53-54 of Bates &amp; Sangrà (at the beginning of Chapter 3, the subhead is: <strong><em>Strategic Goals for Information and Communications Technologies</em></strong>) and the criteria on pp. 71-74 (at the end of Chapter 3 before the conclusion, the subhead is:<strong><em> Criteria for Assessing the Success or Otherwise of Technlogy Integration</em></strong>), identify the main topics that would need to be covered in any strategic plan for technology-based learning for an academic department in your institution?
3. What do you see to be the strengths and weaknesses of a strategic planning approach within your own context? Is it likely to work? If not, why not?

### Key Points <a name="keypoints"></a>  

After completing this unit, we want you to come way with the following key points.  
#### A Vision for Teaching and Learning  
E-learning is much more than just doing the same things with technology. E-Learning provides us with opportunities to approach teaching and learning in new and different ways. This means we need to have a clear vision of how we would like to teach, given the opportunities opened up by new technologies, and from this the development particularly of departmental teaching plans that take into account not only content, but teaching methods and the role of technology in teaching.  
#### The Process is as Important as the Product  
Going through the planning process forces us to think about what we do, what we want to achieve and how we are going to get there. It makes us more reflective and informed and, if done properly, allows us to draw on the collective wisdom and experience of organization rather than relying on a few people. This process is often as important as the strategic plan that we end up with.  
#### Understand and Respect the Collegial Culture  
Understanding the perspective of faculty is critical. This does not mean abandoning a systematic, strategic approach but it does mean ensuring that  faculty members feel involved. It also means that procedures and practices must be properly integrated into the academic core of the institution. This may mean devising new and innovative organizational structures that blend features of centralization with faculty-based support.  
#### Change Will Be Necessary  
If there is one key point we want to emphasize above all others in this unit it is that to effectively implement e-learning at an institutional level will require significant change. Strategic planning isn't always the answer and may not be necessary in all cases but at the very least every organization needs to be thinking about how it will be using e-learning, what changes will be needed to allow for its effective implementation.  

### 4.1 Strategic Planning for E-Learning <a name="strategic"></a>  
#### Planning vs Management  
<p style="text-align: right;"><em>Let our advance worrying become advance thinking and planning.
– Winston Churchill</em></p>
<p style="text-align: right;"><em>Strategic planning is a disciplined effort to shape an organization according to the vision of its leaders by clarifying fundamental decisions and actions. The objective of strategic planning is to create a map by which to manage the organization, define what it does, why it does it and how to do it. -  </em>(<a href="http://www.fivetwelvegroup.com/question.html">http://www.fivetwelvegroup.com</a>)</p>
Before we look at the strategic planning process, it is important to distinguish between the terms “planning” and “management.” We tend to talk about these two processes as one when, in fact, they are quite different components of the overall process of running an institution or organization. As the definition of strategic planning above suggests, planning is about deciding where to go, about creating a map. It involves looking forward, thinking about the big picture but keeping the big picture grounded in the reality of the context of the organization. Management, on the other hand, is about implementing the plan. If we continue with the map analogy, management is about describing in detail the various stops along the route, describing the kind of vehicle we will use to travel the route and what provisions we will need to take along, who will go on the trip and what their roles will be, and starting down the road. So keep this distinction in mind as you work through this unit.  

#### Stages of E-Learning Integration  
As you read in Unit 3, it is helpful to think about the integration of e-learning in higher education as a developmental progression beginning with the the “lone rangers” or the enthusiastic early adopters who experiment with e-learning without any formal institutional support  (sometimes referred to as the Do It Yourself approach) and culminating with the “sustainability” stage when e-learning has become a core activity and has been integrated into the institutional planning and budgeting processes.

Institutions don't necessarily progress through all these stages. It all depends on how widespread the use of e-learning is or will be. It may be that for some institutions a "Do It Yourself" approach is sufficient. Some may stop at the "chaos" stage. But as the use of e-learning grows, it becomes increasingly important for institutions to focus their efforts on moving from the early stages of e-learning development, which is characterized primarily by the efforts of individual faculty, to the higher levels of planning and sustainability, characterized by institutional support and integration. The critical ingredients are an e-learning strategy and the implementation of the strategy.  

#### The Strategic Planning Process  
There is no magic recipe for how to develop a strategic plan for e-learning but the process is as important as the product and unless everybody who has an interest in e-learning has the opportunity to contribute to the development of the plan, the plan is not likely to be very successful. So the most critical step in the process of developing a plan is consultation. Buy-in from faculty, students and staff is crucial and the consultation process must be genuine and meaningful.

When I was leading the <a href="http://commons.bcit.ca/estrategy" target="_blank">development of the BCIT e-learning strategy in 2012</a>, we organized a number of what we called "community consultation sessions". These were 2-3 hour sessions for faculty, students and staff where we sought their views on e-learning and how it should be organized and supported at the institution. We also organized an e-learning showcase at which we demonstrated various e-learning projects that different faculty were involved in. The purpose of this was to share experiences and demonstrate that there was actually quite a lot of innovation already happening at the institution. We found this session to be extremely successful as it helped break down some of the silos and created considerable inter-school communication around e-learning. Unfortunately, as happens quite often, the planning process stalled and the draft plan we developed never was completed and implemented. Fortunately I <a href="http://www3.telus.net/public/a6a06981/estrategy/index.html" target="_blank">archived the site </a>before it was taken down so you can visit it and get a sense of how we approached the process. One part you won't be able to access is the discussion area as this is password protected. The online discussions were the least successful method of consultation. Despite our efforts, we were unable to generate a meaningful online discussion. However, the face-to-face sessions were well attended and generated some very useful feedback that was incorporated into the <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/zwa95gncac8e37r/E-learning%20strategy%20July%209.docx" target="_blank">draft plan</a>.

The process we used to develop the draft plan is described in more detail in<a href="https://app.box.com/s/auayhf1i3jilh4znydvr" target="_blank"><em> Revisiting the Need for Strategic Planning for E-Learning in Higher Education</em>. </a>

Tony Bates describes the process he used to develop a plan for the Southern Alberta Institute of Technology (SAIT) in <em>Strategic Planning for E-Learning in a Polytechnic</em>. See the details below. This is an additional reading so you will need to get this from the library.

Ideally strategic planning should be done at several different levels in an institution. There is no strict rule about where to start but faculty or departmental planning is much easier if an institutional plan already exists. The faculty or departmental plans can then be aligned to the institutional plan. A key component of the faculty or departmental plan is a vision for teaching and learning in the department that outlines how e-learning would be used. In the BCIT example, the process began with the development of an institutional e-learning strategy. The idea was to complete this and then have each school develop its own e-learning strategy. As mentioned earlier, this never happened.

### 4.2 The Elements of a Strategic Plan <a name="elements"></a>
It is important to realize that, while terminology may differ, most strategic plans contain similar components. Sometimes the term “objectives” is used instead of “goals” or “outcomes”. Or purpose is used instead of goal. The concepts of a mission and vision are sometimes used differently in different plans. The point is that, regardless of the labels, most strategic plans contain the same type of information about the organization and in roughly the same order and framework.

The following is a fairly generic framework for a strategic plan:

#### 1. Mission
This should describe what the institution does and who it serves.

#### 2. Environmental Scan
This is an attempt to survey the world around the institution and determine what emerging trends or issues may affect how the institution is organized. In many ways it is similar to a market analysis. It involves trying to anticipate trends and issues that might affect what the what is taught and how it is taught. More specifically, you would want to analyze how trends might affect decisions about the use of e-learning.

#### 3. Rationale for E-learning
This is often overlooked but it is essential because your reasons for giving priority to e-learning will have an impact on how it is implemented and what your goals and objectives will be. For example, if your rationale is primarily about increasing access you will likely focus on a different kind of e-learning than if your rationale is primarily about enhancing ICT skills or changing pedagogy. You may have developed your rationale before you conduct the environmental scan but often the rationale will emerge are at least be influenced by what comes out of the environmental scan.

#### 4. Vision
This is a concrete description of what the organization will look like if and when the strategic plan is fully implemented. It is often useful to develop a vision by describing specific scenarios related to key areas of the plan. For example, what will it be like to be a learner when e-learning is fully-implemented? What will it be like to be an instructor? A faculty or departmental plan should include a vision for teaching and learning  which includes concrete scenarios for how e-learning will be implemented in the department and how, specifically, it will affect the lives of students and instructors.

#### 5. Objectives or Goals
These describe in concrete terms what the institution hopes to achieve by implementing the plan. Achieving the goals entirely would make the vision a reality.

#### 6. Strategies
These are the specific actions that will be taken to implement the plan. The strategies need to be linked clearly to the objectives or goals so it is clear to everybody how you expect them to be achieved.

#### 7. Monitoring
This describes the process of measuring the extent to which the goals have been met so that strategies can be adjusted if necessary.

#### What Makes for a Good Strategic Plan?
So how do you know a good e-learning strategy when you see one? Well, again, there is no magic formula. Not all plans are alike and what is good for one organization may be disastrous for another. Good plans don't all have to be structured in the same way and, as mentioned earlier, the terminology used can vary. The key criterion that separates the good from the mediocre or bad is <strong>the extent to which the plan provides concrete and realistic goals and strategies for achieving those goals</strong>. It is very easy to draft lofty mission statements and ambitious goals about how your organization is going to be a leader in innovative e-learning but unless the plan spells out in detail how you are going to get there and what you mean by innovation and e-learning and how individual faculty will contribute to achieving the goals, the plan won't be worth the paper it is printed on.

Review the draft <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/zwa95gncac8e37r/E-learning%20strategy%20July%209.docx" target="_blank">BCIT strategic plan for e-learning</a> as well as the draft <a href="https://app.box.com/s/r4xhmubg8udpzyql3dau" target="_blank">ICT in Education Strategy for Belize.</a> I was involved in developing both of these and while I'm not suggesting these are perfect, I do think they contain the key elements of a good plan. What do you think?

Find two or three other strategic plans from different institutions or organizations and review them. There is a link below to some institutional e-learning strategies. How do they measure up? What, if anything is missing? What are similarities and differences?

### 4.3 Conclusion <a name="conclusion"></a>
The use of e-learning opens up completely new possibilities for teaching, and thinking strategically is critical to the success of e-learning. This requires the development of a clear vision of how one would like to teach, given the opportunities opened up by new technologies, and from this the development particularly of departmental teaching plans that take into account not only content, but teaching methods and the role of technology in teaching.

However, It is worth remembering what former American President Dwight Eisenhower said about planning: “plans are nothing; planning is everything.” With strategic planning, the process is often more valuable than the product. Going through the planning process forces us to think about what we do, what we want to achieve and how we are going to get there. It makes us more reflective and informed and, if done properly, allows us to draw on the collective wisdom and experience of organization rather than relying on a few people. Events will probably force us to change our plans but if we have planned properly we will probably be in a better position to adapt our plans to changing circumstances.

As we plan for e-learning we need to be sensitive to the fact that not everybody with an interest in the process sees the issues from the same perspective.  Faculty are the key people in this process and their values and goals may be different from those of administrators and students. We need to understand their world-view and adapt to it rather than fight against it. This does not mean abandoning a systematic, strategic approach but it does mean smoothing its managerial edges, building in flexibility, avoiding the use of overly managerial terminology and, above all, ensuring that  faculty members feel involved. It also means that procedures and practices must be properly integrated into the academic core of the institution. This may mean devising new and innovative organizational structures that blend features of centralization with faculty-based support.

If there is one key point we want to emphasize above all others in this unit it is that to effectively implement e-learning at an institutional level will require significant change. Many of you may feel that you are not able to exert much influence in your organization in the planning and management of e-learning, because you are not sufficiently senior in the organization. However, one day you probably will be in such a position (especially, we hope, because of the skills you have learned in this course). More immediately, most of your senior managers are desperately in need of help. Throughout the western world, university and college presidents and their Vice-Presidents and Deans are struggling with these issues, and do not have in most cases the understanding of e-learning, or the skills of managing this area. You, though, are now in a position to provide that help, and we wish you all success in your endeavours.
