### Assignment 1:  Analysis and Comparison of Rationales for E-learning <a name="assignment1"></a>

The purpose of this assignment is to have you start the process of examining institutional or organizational planning for e-learning. Your task is to find two institutional or organizational e-learning strategies and analyze them in terms of their explicit and implicit rationales for promoting e-learning. You can also use national/state/provincial e-learning strategies or policies for this assignment.

This assignment draws primarily on<strong> Unit 1: Understanding E-learning</strong> but you may want to look ahead to Units 4 and 5 which deal with institutional and government planning for e-learning, although this isn't essential.

Consider the following questions as you analyze the rationale for e-learning in each strategy.:
<ol>
	<li>What is the stated rationale for e-learning?</li>
	<li>What is the unstated rationale or hidden agenda? What evidence do you have for this?</li>
	<li>How defensible are the rationales?</li>
	<li>How is is e-learning defined or understood, explicitly or implicitly, in the strategy or policy and what is your assessment of this definition/understanding? For example, does it portray e-learning has a range of possibilities as shown on the e-learning continuum or is e-learning defined more narrowly?</li>
</ol>
The assignment should consist of three parts:
<ol>
	<li>A brief overview of the two strategies that describes context</li>
	<li>An analysis of each strategy in terms of their rationales for e-learning. This should form the bulk of the assignment.</li>
	<li>A brief summary and conclusion.</li>
</ol>
Be sure to provide evidence from the strategies to support your analysis of the rationales.

In assessing your assignment your instructor will be applying the following criteria:
<ol>
	<li>How well have you described the context for the two strategies?</li>
	<li>Have you provided direct evidence of your analysis and conclusions about the rationales for e-learning?</li>
	<li>How well does the assignment draw on material in Units 1?</li>
</ol>
<h3><strong>Submitting the Assignment</strong></h3>
<strong>Maximum</strong> length for the assignment is<strong> 2</strong><strong>,500 words.</strong>

Upload your assignment to the Blackboard Connect assignment dropbox. It should be in Word format.

### Assignment 2: E-Learning Readiness Audit <a name="assignment2"></a>

<strong><em>This assignment can be done as a group. See the Group Assignment information below.</em></strong>

Using Unit 2 as a starting point, develop or adapt an existing e-learning readiness audit tool. Explain the decision making behind your tool adaptation or creation. If you adapted an existing tool, justify your selection of that tool and the reasoning behind the changes you made to it. If you developed your own tool, explain your rationale. In either case, explain how the tool will help you assess the e-learning readiness of the organization you are examining.

Use that tool to assess the e-learning readiness of <strong>an organization or institution</strong>. Ideally this will be <strong>a higher education organization</strong> that you work for, or one that you are quite familiar with. <strong><em>Please note that an e-learning readiness audit of a program, faculty or school within a larger organization is NOT acceptable.</em></strong>

Note also that the assessment is not meant to be a laborious, time-consuming process that involves the administration of surveys and the collection of primary data (although you are welcome to do this if you like). It should be based on publicly available information on the organization and your subjective assessment of the readiness of the organization, based on this information and the audit tool.

The assignment should consist of:
<ol>
	<li>A description of the readiness tool that you developed or adapted and an explanation of the decision making that went in to the tool creation or adaptation.</li>
	<li>An assessment of institution/organization in terms of each factor in your readiness audit tool and a discussion the implications. For example, if you find that the organization’s IT infrastructure is inadequate, explain what would be needed to bring up to an appropriate level and what this means for the ability of the institution/organization to implement e-learning.</li>
	<li>A discussion of the overall readiness of the organization based on your audit.</li>
	<li>Recommendations for the next steps in planning and implementing e-learning at the organization.</li>
</ol>
We recommend that you use the four elements above as the structure of your assignment.

In assessing your assignment your instructor will be applying the following criteria:
<ol>
	<li>How well have you described the readiness tool that you developed or adapted?</li>
	<li>How clear, logical and well-supported is your explanation of your decision making process related to the tool creation or adaptation?</li>
	<li>How well have you explained your assessment of each factor?</li>
	<li>How well have you discussed the implications of your assessment of each factor?</li>
	<li>To what extent is the analysis supported by direct evidence from the audit?</li>
	<li>To what extent have the recommendations for planning and implementation been justified and supported with evidence from the audit?</li>
	<li>How well does the assignment draw on material from the course, particularly Unit 2.</li>
</ol>

### Assignment 3: Analysis and Comparison of Approaches to E-Learning <a name="assignment3"></a>
<em><strong>This assignment can be done as an individual or a group assignment. See the group assignment information below.</strong></em>

There are three options for this assignment:

Option 1: Institutional/organizational e-learning strategies

Option 2: Institutional/organizational approaches to implementation of e-learning

Option 3: Government approaches to planning e-learning.

Depending on the option you choose, your task in this assignment is to select two institutional/organizational e-learning strategies, two institutional/organizational approaches to the implementation of e-learning or two government approaches to planning e-learning and review, analyze and compare them and provide your overall assessment of their merit. You should draw on the material in units 4, 5 and 6 for this assignment.

The first step is to find the plans or strategies to analyze and compare. Institutional or organizational e-learning strategies for option 1 are probably the easiest to find. If universities or colleges have e-learning strategies they are usually available from their websites. Researching option 2 may be a bit more difficult as you will need to examine how the institutions appear to be implementing e-learning based on information on their websites, your personal knowledge or experience, or from contacts you have within these organizations. In some cases, you may be able to find implementation plans that are publicly available. For Option 3, you would be looking for at a state/provincial, regional or national plans or initiatives. They could be a stand-alone e-learning strategies or initiatives or an e-learning strategies or initiatives that are embedded within a broader strategy (educational, ICT etc).
<h3>Option 1</h3>
For Option 1 we want you to continue exercising your analytical skills by conducting a broader analysis and comparison of two e-learning strategies. You can choose a school, school board, university, college or training organization or department. <strong>One of the organizations can the the one you used for assignment 2.</strong>

Ideally the organizations you choose will have clear plans for e-learning that are either stand-alone or embedded within other educational or organizational plans. The organizations should be similar, i.e two schools, two higher education institutions etc.

In  conducting your analysis, consider the following questions:
<ol>
	<li>How do the plans propose that e-learning should be organized, supported and delivered in the organizations?</li>
	<li>What are the strengths and weaknesses of these proposals?</li>
	<li>How do you think the organizations' approaches to e-learning could be strengthened? Justify your recommendations.</li>
</ol>
This assignment should contain three parts:
<ol>
	<li>A brief overview of the strategies you have chosen to analyze and the institutional or organizational contexts.</li>
	<li>An analysis and comparison of the strategies that addresses the questions above. This should form the bulk of the assignment.</li>
	<li>A brief summary and conclusion.</li>
</ol>
In assessing your assignment instructors will be applying the following criteria:
<ol>
	<li>How clear is the overview of the strategies and the description of the institutional/organizational contexts?</li>
	<li>How well does the assignment draw on material and ideas from the course?</li>
	<li>To what extent is the analysis supported by direct evidence from the strategies or plans?</li>
	<li>To what extent have the recommendations for strengthening the plans been justified?</li>
</ol>
<h3>Option 2</h3>
For option 2 we want you to select two institutional/organizational approaches to the <strong>implementation of e-learning</strong> and analyze and compare them with a focus on how the plans are either <strong>being implemented or are expected to be implemented</strong>. You can use the strategies you examined for assignment #1 as the basis for this assignment but remember, the focus of this assignment is on <strong>the implementation of e-learning</strong>. This means the strategies you analyze should contain specific details about <strong>the implementation of e-learning</strong> within the organizations (i.e., implementation plans) or, if they don't,  you must be able to gather evidence of how the plans are being implemented. <strong>One of the organizations can the the one you used for assignment 2.</strong>

In conducting your analysis, consider the following questions:
<ol>
	<li>What is your assessment of how the plans are either being implemented or are proposed to be implemented. In answering this question you should consider how e-learning is being, or is proposed to be, organized, supported and delivered in the organizations?</li>
	<li>What are the strengths and weaknesses of the implementation plans or the actual implementations?</li>
	<li>How do you think the organizations' approach to and implementation of e-learning could be strengthened? Justify your recommendations.</li>
</ol>
The assignment should contain three parts:
<ol>
	<li>A brief overview of the strategies you have chosen to analyze and the institutional or organizational context.</li>
	<li>An analysis of the strategies and implementation plans that addresses the questions above. This should form the bulk of the assignment.</li>
	<li>A brief summary and conclusion.</li>
</ol>
In assessing your assignment instructors will be applying the following criteria:
<ol>
	<li>How clear is the overview of the strategies and implementation plans and the description of the institutional/organizational contexts?</li>
	<li>How well does the assignment draw on material and ideas from the course?</li>
	<li>To what extent is the analysis supported by direct evidence from the strategies or plans?</li>
	<li>To what extent have the recommendations for strengthening the strategies and implementation plans been justified?</li>
	<li>How well does the assignment draw on material and ideas from the course, particularly Units 2, 3, 4 and 6.</li>
</ol>
<h3> Option 3</h3>
For option 3 we want you to turn your attention to the government level and conduct an analysis and comparison of two national, provincial/state or regional plans for and/or approaches to e-learning.

The first step is to find two plans to analyze. These could be at a state/provincial, regional or national level and they could be stand-alone e-learning strategies or an e-learning strategies that are embedded within broader strategies (educational, ICT etc).

Once you have identified the plans, analyze them in terms of their strengths and weaknesses using the material and ideas from the course, particularly Unit 5.

Use the following questions as starting points to guide your analysis:
<ol>
	<li>What steps have been taken to influence universities, colleges and schools to innovate and change? How appropriate do you consider these strategies?</li>
	<li>What steps have been taken to influence educational institutions and systems to use e-learning to address new markets and new needs in education, e.g, skill gaps? How appropriate do you consider these strategies and policies?</li>
	<li>What policies have been recommended related to the investment in new technologies within the education system? How appropriate are they?</li>
	<li>What is the ideology underlying the approach to e-learning?</li>
	<li>What is motivating the e-learning policies and strategies?</li>
	<li>What issues is the strategy trying to address?</li>
	<li>Is a strong role in planning for e-learning being assumed or a more hands-off approach? What do you think of this approach?</li>
</ol>
You should give concrete examples to justify your analysis. You should include a brief description of the education system that you are referring to.

In assessing your assignment instructors will be applying the following criteria:
<ol>
	<li>How clearly described are the education systems that are being discussed?</li>
	<li>How well does the assignment identify issues in the education systems that might be addressed by the use of e-learning?</li>
	<li>How well does the assignment draw on material and ideas from the course, particularly Unit 5?</li>
</ol>
