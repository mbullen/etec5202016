The effective implementation of e-learning in higher education requires the appropriate organizational structures and governance mechanisms to ensure that faculty and students get the support they need to use e-learning. Bates &amp; Sangrà (2011) stress that the successful implementation of e-learning <em>"requires daily and continuous attention throughout the organization...[and]...ongoing mechanisms in place to deal with technology issues as they arise" (</em>p. 103).

There are four key dimensions to the organization and support of e-learning:
<ol>
	<li>What governance mechanisms are in place;</li>
	<li>Where it fits in the organizational structure and hierarchy of the institution,</li>
	<li>How the support is organized and provided,</li>
	<li>How it is funded.</li>
</ol>
However, it is important to remember that there are many different ways to organize e-learning in institutions and that the most appropriate approach will depend on the size of the organization, the type of organization, how e-learning will be used and how widely it will be implemented. It is helpful in this regard to understand at what stage of e-learning integration the institution is before deciding on the most appropriate way of organizing e-learning.

In this unit we look the stages of e-learning integration and discuss the governance issues, organizational structure, different models of support and funding models for e-learning in higher education institutions.

#### Recommended

### Key Points <a name="keypoints"></a>
After completing this unit, we want you to come away with the following key points:    
#### 1. Stages of E-Learning Integration  
E-learning typically progresses through a series of stages that begins with the enthusiastic early adopters who experiment with e-learning without any formal institutional support and culminates with the “sustainability” stage at which e-learning has been fully integrated into the institutional planning and budgeting processes. In between institutions move from “encouragement” to “chaos” and then to the penultimate “planning” stage when senior management begins to integrate e-learning into the planning process.  
#### 2. Governance  
Governance is about how decisions are made about current and future plans for e-learning and technology more broadly and who makes those decisions. It involves evaluating, directing and monitoring the use of e-learning. There several different ways of providing appropriate governance over e-learning. The most common is to establish some type committee to provide oversight and allow stakeholders to have input.  
#### 3. Organizational Structure  
Where e-learning fits in the institution’s organizational structure and the reporting structure of the organization is critical to the success of e-learning. Is it located on the academic/educational side of the organization or on the technical or administrative side? The answers to these questions will tell us how seriously the institution takes e-learning.  
#### 4. Organizational Model  
There are a variety of different approaches to supporting e-learning, ranging from fully integrated central support departments that provide IT, instructional design, faculty development and technical media support to a fully decentralized approach in which each Faculty or School has its own support units. The most appropriate model  depends on the institution and the size of the faculties and the level of support within the institution and faculties. Bates &amp; Sangrà argue that  the specific organizational model is less important than having a “clear picture of responsibilities and authority for decision-making about technology. In other words, institutions should have a clear governance structure for technology” (p. 121).  
#### 5. Funding Models  
How e-learning support is funded in the institution is as important, if not more, than how the support is organized. There are four basic funding models:
<ol>
	<li>Base funded</li>
	<li>Revenue generating</li>
	<li>Grant funded</li>
	<li>Combined funding</li>
</ol>

### 3.1 Stages of E-Learning Integration <a name="stages"></a>
Bates (2007) argues that higher education institutions typically move through five stages as they introduce and ultimately integrate e-learning . This begins with “lone rangers”, the enthusiastic early adopters who experiment with e-learning without any formal institutional support and culminates with the “sustainability” stage at which e-learning has become a core activity and has been integrated into the institutional planning and budgeting processes. In between these beginning and end points, institutions provide progressively more support for e-learning, moving from “encouragement” to “chaos” and then to the penultimate “planning” stage when senior management finally begins to take e-learning seriously by starting to integrate it into the institutional planning process.

As the use of e-learning grows, it is becoming increasingly important for institutions to focus their efforts on moving from the early stages of e-learning development, which is characterized primarily by the efforts of individual faculty, to the higher levels of planning and sustainability, characterized by institutional support and integration. The critical ingredients are an e-learning strategy and the implementation of the strategy.

### 3.2 Organizational Structure and Governance <a name="orgstructure"></a>
#### The Governance of E-Learning  
Governance is about how decisions are made about current and future plans for e-learning and technology more broadly and who makes those decisions. It involves evaluating, directing and monitoring the use of e-learning. Two conflicting pressures are making e-learning and technology governance much more complex than it used to be. On the one hand institutions need to have enterprise-wide infrastructure, particularly related to networking and security. There is also a strong argument for having some enterprise-level e-learning applications such as a learning management system and virtual classroom systems. On the other hand, many other applications are becoming increasingly user-driven, networked and cloud-based and lose much of their value if they are confined behind a college or university firewall. For example, the main value of social networking services is the ability to connect and network with people anywhere in the world. Bates &amp; Sangrà conclude: <em>"A model of governance is needed that enables both the needs of the institution as a whole and the needs of the many end users to be accommodated. The role of IT professionals in providing leadership in technology management and innovation remains critical, but increasingly this role is being shared with end users, such as faculty and administrators" (</em>p. 124).

#### Academic Technology Committees
One of the most common governance mechanisms in higher education is the academic or educational technology committee. E-learning and educational technology cut across academic, technical and support areas so it is important to ensure that the diversity of needs and perspectives is taken into account when implementing e-learning. Too often e-learning is seen as primarily a technical issue and governance committees tend to be dominated or driven by IT departments when really the educators should be setting the agenda. Along with membership, the key issues to consider in establishing educational technology committees are mandate, decision-making authority, reporting structure and whether it is a permanent, ad hoc or temporary committee.

--- | ---  
#### Organizational Structure
Closely related to governance is where e-learning fits in the institution's organizational structure and the reporting structure of the organization, e.g., does it reside in the portfolio of one of the senior administrators? Is it located on the academic/educational side of the organization or on the technical or administrative side? The answers to these questions will tell us how seriously the institution takes e-learning. The academic/educational portfolio is where the power lies in all academic organizations so clearly if responsibility for e-learning is in this portfolio it sends a strong message. However, it is also critical to look at who has responsibility for e-learning, where they fit in the hierarchy, and what else that person has in her or his portfolio. Obviously the more senior the person, the better but if that person has such a large and diverse portfolio that they can't devote the time needed to e-learning, it may be better to have somebody less senior with responsibility. For example, when I was the Dean of the Learning &amp; Teaching Centre (LTC) at BCIT I had responsibility for e-learning and I sat on the Deans' Council along with the School Deans and the Vice-President of Education. This gave our department direct input into the academic governance of the institution. However about two years after I left, responsibility for the Learning &amp; Teaching Centre was given to the Dean of the School of Computing &amp; Academic Studies. While technically this didn't change the status of the LTC because it was still led by a Dean, it did effectively diminish its status because this Dean's primary responsibility was his School and he couldn't provide hands-on leadership of the LTC. As well, because he represents a School, I would argue it would make it difficult for him to adequately present an institutional perspective on e-learning. In the most recent development in this case, I have just learned that the Learning &amp; Teaching Centre at BCIT will now (as of September 2014) report to a new Associate Dean of Educational Resources reporting the Vice-President, Education. The jury is out on what this means and whether this a positive organizational change.

So you can see this a complicated issue and the ideal organizational arrangement depends on how e-learning is going to be used and how widespread the proposed implementation will be. In the next section we look at the different models of organization support.
#### Questions
<ol>
	<li>Does the organization of academic technology support services need re-organizing in your institution? If so, how would you do that and why?</li>
	<li>Do you think your institution might be willing to spend at least 5% of its teaching budget on academic technology support (if it's not already doing so)? How would you try to 'sell' this to your management?</li>
	<li>Guri-Rosenblit (2005) points to eight paradoxes that she says helps to explain the the wide gap between the rhetoric and the reality of e-learning implementation in higher education. Is her analysis relevant to institutional situations that you are aware of?</li>

### 3.3 Models of Support <a name="models"></a>
Institutions have taken a variety of different approaches to supporting e-learning, ranging from fully integrated central support departments that provide IT, instructional design, faculty development and technical media support to a fully decentralized approach in which each faculty or school has its own support units. Almost all institutions have a central IT department but the range of services provided is changing with an increasing number being either decentralized to individual faculties or schools or contracted out to cloud-based providers.

#### Centralized Departments
Centralized departments that are funded from the institution's core budget are often seen as the most desired approach because they provide more stable support that isn't dependent on generating revenue or attracting grant funding. They also make it possible to develop a critical mass of expertise that will be available to the entire institution. They can also be more cost effective as resources can be allocated more efficiently across an institution than across a small faculty. For example, there may not be enough work in a single faculty or school for a multimedia developer but more than enough work across the institution. With a decentralized approach in which each faculty or school provides its own support either some expertise will not be available or it will not be provided as efficiently because economies of scale are not possible.

On the other hand, centralized departments can often be seen as remote and unresponsive to the needs of faculties and individual faculty members. More often than not they operate according to project management principles which can create conflicts with some faculty who resist the idea of relinquishing control of their projects to others. I discuss this issue in the chapter, <a href="http://www.box.net/shared/r53j4jtl4x" target="_blank"><em>When Worlds Collide: Project Management and the Collegial Culture</em>,</a> which you read in an earlier unit.

A well-funded centralized unit can also become a target of cost-cutting when times get tough. There is a tendency in colleges and universities to regard anything "non-academic" as less important or even an unnecessary frill. When institutions are facing budget cuts (which seems to be an almost permanent state these days), faculties tend to look to the non-academic departments before they look at their own operations. Since institutions are governed by Deans and senior administrators who are beholden to Deans, it's not surprising that a well-funded e-learning department would be seen as source of funding that could be used to prevent any cuts to the academic operations. This is even more likely if the e-learning department does not sit on the academic side of the organization, as is often the case. By this I mean that it doesn't report to the senior administrator (e.g., Vice-President) responsible for education but instead is situated on the administrative side.
#### Decentralized Departments
Decentralized departments have the advantage of being closer, both physically and organizationally, to faculty members. A faculty-based support unit will likely be more attuned to the particular culture of the faculty and the needs of the faculty members. They tend to be smaller and thus, possibly, more agile and responsive compared to large central units that have to balance competing priorities from a variety of different faculties. However, as mentioned earlier, they may not have the same ability to provide for a full range of services and expertise. This will depend on the size of the faculty and the level of funding provided but it is difficult to achieve the economies of scale that are possible with a large central unit.

Neither of these models is clearly superior. It really depends on the institution and the size of the faculties and the level of support within the institution and faculties. For example, if the central department is not well-supported both financially and organizationally, it may be preferable to let each faculty take care of its own support. This may produce an inconsistent level of support across the institution but at least the faculties that decided to make e-learning a priority would provide a higher level of support than might be available from a weak and poorly-funded central department.

Bates &amp; Sangrà conclude that the specific organizational model is less important than having a "clear picture of responsibilities and authority for decision-making about technology. In other words, institutions should have a clear governance structure for technology" (p. 121).

### 3.4 Funding Models <a name="funding"></a>
How e-learning support is funded in the institution is as important, if not more, than how the support is organized. There are four basic funding models:
<ol>
	<li>Base funded</li>
	<li>Revenue generating</li>
	<li>Grant funded</li>
	<li>Combined funding</li>
</ol>
#### Base Funded  
Base funding simply means that the e-learning support unit, whether centralized or decentralized, receives a budget allocation from the institution's (or faculty's, in the case of decentralized) core budget. The department must make a budget request every year like all other departments and justify its request. This normally results in relatively stable funding from year to year, assuming there are no financial crises or institution-wide budget cuts. (These days, perhaps this is no longer a reasonable assumption.) Certainly in good economic times a base-funded model is preferable as it eliminates the need to generate revenue and allows the department to focus on its core business of supporting faculty in their use of e-learning. It also helps establish the organizational status of the department. Revenue-generating units tend to be viewed as peripheral or marginal to the mandate of the institution.  
#### Revenue-generating  
A revenue-generating department will be basically self-supporting. It will generate its funding by selling its services either internally, externally or both. The key advantage of this model is that the department is somewhat insulated from the cyclical budget cutting that has been become commonplace in higher education. Since a revenue-generating department isn't seeking any funding from the institutional budget, when it comes time to cut budgets, it is safe. However, the downside of his model is that the department must expend considerable effort finding sources of revenue. This can often mean diverting energy away from the core business of supporting faculty to providing services to fulfill external contracts. And when revenue-generating departments sell their services internally, this can act as a deterrent to faculty use of the services. I witnessed this at UBC between 1982 and 2005. The Distance Education &amp; Technology department operated on a combined model of roughly 50% central support and 50% revenue generation. Faculties grew increasingly frustrated with having to pay for some services but not others and there was confusion about how the financial model worked. For example, all the tuition fees generated by distance education courses flowed back to the distance education department not to the faculties that developed the courses. This funding was used to support our student services function. But some Deans didn't understand this and felt they should be getting the tuition revenues even though they weren't providing the student support. The net result was a growing disenchantment with the model, a growth in faculty-based support units, and growing calls to completely decentralize the services. In fact, a plan was put in place to just this in 2005 but it was cancelled at the last minute when the Deans who were behind it actually added up the numbers and realized there would be no revenue windfall for them. Ironically, 10 years later UBC has an even larger central support unit (the Centre for Teaching, Learning &amp; Technology) that was created by bringing together several formally separate departments.  
#### Grant Funded  
A grant-funded model is one in which the operations are supported from one-time or limited grant funds of various sorts. These could be external grants from donor agencies or governments or internal grant funds. At UBC, the faculty development department, Teaching and Academic Growth (TAG) which existed for many years until it was rolled into the new Centre for Teaching Learning and Technology, was funded on this basis. Each year it had to submit a proposal for funding from an internal university fund designed to support teaching innovation. This meant that from year to year it never knew if it would be able to continue its operations the next year. This created a great deal of uncertainly for anybody working there and meant that it was a difficult to launch multi-year projects. A similar approach was taken with the Office of Learning Technologies which also was subsequently folded into the Centre for Teacking Learning and Technology. Grant-funding may be a useful way to experiment with a new organizational approach but it is not appropriate as a funding model for something the institution deems to be part of its core operations.  
#### Combined Funding  
A combined funding model in many ways is the worst of both worlds. It exposes the department to the budget cycles and the dangers of budget cutting while also requiring the department to expend energy and resources seeking revenue from internal and external sources. It also can create conflict within the department (and institution) and difficulty in setting priorities. Who should get priority access to the departmental resources: external clients who are paying for them or faculty members who are not? Unless the revenue-generating and budget-funded operations of the department are distinct, there are bound to be conflicts about priorities.

### 3.5 Conclusion <a name="conclusion"></a>
In this unit we have examined how e-learning should be organized and supported within an institution. As we have argued from the beginning of this course, there are no right and wrong ways of doing things. The most appropriate approach depends on the context and this means taking into account the stage of e-learning integration that the institution has achieved. E-learning typically progresses through a series of stages that begins with the enthusiastic early adopters who experiment with e-learning without any formal institutional support and culminates with the “sustainability” stage at which e-learning has been fully integrated into the institutional planning and budgeting processes. In between institutions move from “encouragement” to “chaos” and then to the penultimate “planning” stage when senior management begins to integrate e-learning into the planning process.

The governance of e-learning is about how decisions are made, who has input and who makes those decisions. It also involves evaluating, directing and monitoring the use of e-learning. There several different ways of providing appropriate governance over e-learning. The most common is to establish some type committee to provide oversight and allow stakeholders to have input.

Equally important is where e-learning fits in the institution’s organizational structure and the reporting structure of the organization. Is it located on the academic/educational side of the organization or on the technical or administrative side? The answers to these questions will tell us how seriously the institution takes e-learning.

How e-learning is support can vary from having a fully integrated central support department that provides IT, instructional design, faculty development and technical media support to a fully decentralized approach in which each faculty or school has its own support units. The most appropriate model depends on the institution and the size of the faculties and the level of support within the institution and faculties.

Finally, how e-learning support is funded in the institution is as important, if not more, than how the support is organized. There are four basic funding models:
<ol>
	<li>Base funded</li>
	<li>Revenue generating</li>
	<li>Grant funded</li>
	<li>Combined funding</li>
</ol>
