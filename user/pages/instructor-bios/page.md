The Commonwealth of Learning is an intergovernmental organization, with headquarters in Vancouver, that assists developing Commonwealth countries to improve their educational systems by using open and flexible distance learning approaches. Before joining COL in October of 2012 I spent seven years at the <a href="http://www.bcit.ca/ltc">BC Institute of Technology (BCIT)</a> as Dean and Associate Dean of the Learning &amp; Teaching Centre.

From 1982 to 2005 I worked at the University of British Columbia where I was a media producer, instructional designer and project manager before serving as Associate and Acting Director of the Distance Education &amp; Technology department and Director of the Centre for Managing &amp; Planning E-Learning (MAPLE), a research centre that investigated institutional planning and management issues, policy, and social and educational impacts of e-learning.

I have extensive international consulting experience related to online course development and the planning and management of e-learning. I have taught workshops on developing and delivering online instruction and the planning and management of e-learning in Australia, Mexico, Malaysia, Taiwan, Bhutan, Croatia and Canada and I have been a consultant on distance education projects in Mongolia, Indonesia and Bhutan.

I was centrally involved in the development of the MET. In addition to teaching this course, I co-developed and taught the original Foundations of Educational Technology (ETEC 511). From 1997 to 2002 I was on the development and teaching team for the Postgraduate Certificate in Technology-based Distributed Learning.

In addition to the many years I have spent working in distance education and educational technology, from 1976 to 1980 I worked at the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation as a television news journalist.

I have a Ph.D. in Adult Education (1997), a Masters degree in Educational Psychology (1989) and a B.Ed. (1982) from the University of British Columbia.

I started working in the area of distance education and technology more than 10 years ago, at the Distance Education and Technology department at UBC (now the Centre for Teaching, Learning &amp; Technology) with the research group: Centre for Managing and Planning Learning Environments (MAPLE). As one of the researchers at MAPLE I examined different aspects of the impacts of e-learning on university infrastructure and student life, in connection with the institutional planning strategies, and the issues of higher education accessibility and affordability.

I have presented the research findings at conferences and workshops in Canada (University of Ontario Institute of Technology, Durham College, Oshawa, May 2004; The Society for College and University Planning, Toronto, July, 2004; Canadian Association for Distance Education, Toronto, June, 2004); in the United States (Western Cooperative for Educational Telecommunications, November, 2004, San Antonio) and People’s Republic of China (International Conference on Web-based Learning, City University of Hong Kong, August, 2005, Hong Kong). I have a Ph.D (1997) in Sociology from the Ural State University, where in 1998 I had started teaching and conducting research specializing in Sociology of Knowledge, Gender and Globalization, Research techniques, Teaching methods and Sociolinguistics. My current academic interests are impact analysis and modeling, critical studies in technology and social impacts of technological solutions, instructional design and online educational experiences.
