### Introduction
In this unit we are going to look at institutional readiness in terms of how e-learning is implemented and supported. The main players are the service units, departments or other such groups that play a role in making e-learning operational. These are the groups that are involved in organizational planning and management of courses and support services for learners or employees and faculty members or trainers. Individuals within these departments may also play a key role in the delivery of these courses and services as well.

As you saw in the unit on <a href="http://blogs.ubc.ca/etec5202015/unit-3/" target="_blank">Institutional Organization and Support,</a> service departments in a university or college can be organized in several different ways. Typically they are either central departments with a mandate to serve the whole campus, or faculty-based departments that support specific faculties or schools. In a private corporation or government organization, such a department might exist within a Human Resources department, training centre or professional development group involved in creating training and program materials for employees or clients. However, in any of these contexts, it is likely that the motivation to develop e-learning will come as often from individual faculty members or trainers as it will come from formalized project teams. Further, when thinking about program planning, we are assuming that a set of courses is being proposed or developed.  As such, it is important to be thinking strategically about how courses are developed and maintained, how students and professors are supported, and how the courses are delivered within an institution.

In all of these areas, both top-down and bottom-up approaches are likely to be encountered and there are likely to be both initiatives driven by enthusiastic individuals as well as more formal projects that are being developed using project management approaches. An understanding of the potential advantages and limitations of these approaches will assist you in coming up with an approach for developing e-learning materials that makes sense in your context.
### Learning Outcomes<a name="outcomes"></a>
By the end of this unit, participants will be able to:
<ul>
	<li>Compare the strengths and weaknesses of different models for program and course development</li>
	<li>Evaluate appropriate development approaches for their own organizations</li>
	<li>Discuss the key elements of the project management approach to course development</li>
	<li>Explain the key phases of course development</li>
	<li>Explain the roles and responsibilities of project team members</li>
</ul>
#### Guiding Questions  
Use the following questions to guide your thinking as you study this unit:
<ol>
	<li>Is there any evidence for what Bates &amp; Sangrà says about Lone Rangers? Does it match what is happening in your institution?</li>
	<li>Bates and Sangrà list five elements of quality in technology-based projects (see p. 146). Do you agree with these?  Can you think of other elements of quality that might be at least as important?
If you are interested in following up on the quality control of technology-based learning, look at the following:
<a href="http://www.futured.com/pdf/distance.pdf" target="_blank">Quality Guidelines for Technology-assisted Distance Education </a>(PDF).
<a href="http://www.ihep.org/assets/files/publications/m-r/QualityOnTheLine.pdf" target="_blank">Quality On the Line: Benchmarks for Success in Internet-Based Distance Education (PDF). </a>For other quality assurance documents from this organization, go to:
<a href="http://www.futured.com/library.htm" target="_blank">FuturEd.Com</a></li>
	<li>If you can, try and read right through the <a href="https://app.box.com/shared/b5tzvdlds9" target="_blank">DET Project Development Manual</a> but at a minimum make sure you read at least one sample course proposal and one sample letter of agreement. Note that this reflects a model where money is held back centrally, then allocated to individual applicants. Would this work in your institution? If not, could you run a project management model at a departmental level?</li>
	<li>Would or does project management work in your context? If not, what would need to be done to make it work?</li>
	<li>What do you think of managerialism, in the form of strategic planning and project management? Does it rob professors and instructors of their autonomy, and if so, is that necessarily a problem?</li>
	<li>According to Tony Bates, "Faculty development is necessary but not sufficient to ensure the adoption of new technologies for teaching". Do you agree?</li>
	<li>Will the adoption of e-learning inevitably mean an increase in the workload of faculty who do this? What can be done to avoid or reduce e-learning-related workload?</li>
	<li>In their article, <em>Faculty 2.0,</em> Hartman et al. suggest that faculty will have to adapt to the changing nature of students and how they use and think of technology. Do you agree with with their conclusions?</li>
</ol>

</ul>

### Key Points <a name="keypoints"></a>
After completing this unit you should come away with the following key points:
#### 1. Approaches to Course Development
In most organizations, some combination of Lone Ranger and Project Management approaches is likely needed to allow for broad innovation and strategic implementation of e-learning. As you move from the left to the right across the e-learning continuum, from e-learning as classroom enhancements to fully online e-learning, you also move from the realm of Lone Ranger approaches to the realm of project management approaches to development.  With the added complexity associated with fully online projects, a project management approach becomes essential in ensuring that developments are completed within agreed upon schedules and budgets.  Without such managed approaches, it becomes more and more risky for an organization to undertake large-scale e-learning. Nevertheless, project management is not always the best or most cost-effective model.
#### 2. The Project Team
When a project management approach is used, a project team. The following are the typical members of an online course development project team:
<ul>
	<li>Subject matter expert</li>
	<li>Instructional designer</li>
	<li>Web developer</li>
	<li>Project Manager</li>
	<li>Media designer</li>
	<li>Learner support specialist</li>
</ul>

#### 3. Funding and Development Support
The funding approach and how development is supported in an institution will  play a role in determining what kind of core project team can be brought together. In many universities it is common for project teams to be composed of people who are hired specifically for the project (typically on part-time or limited term contracts).   This affects continuity, as it is difficult to retain those people who have gained experience working on a project year to year. Another common approach to supporting the development of fully online e-learning projects is to have them resourced using a combination of professors, whose time is acquired to work on a project through buy-out or course release, with the support of a professional development group from a centre that has long-term, permanent staff. By positioning such staff in a centre or unit to support e-learning development, an institution is able to maintain a consistent level of quality resources to support on-going development year-to-year. Such a resource, however, depends upon predictable, on-going funding from the institution.
#### 4. Faculty Support
Institutions need to use a systematic approach to faculty development that goes far beyond the typical training in how to use the tools. This means teaching faculty not only how to use the technology but how students learn, how knowledge is represented through different media. It means examining different approaches to learning, and deciding how technology best works with either approach. Ideally, there would be a one-year, intensive, mandatory, pre-service training program that covers the following topics:
<ul>
	<li>Epistemology</li>
	<li>The biological basis of learning</li>
	<li>Learning theories</li>
	<li>The design of teaching</li>
	<li>Learning technologies</li>
	<li>Project work related to the design and delivery of an e-learning course</li>
	<li>Electives that might include courses on research in teaching and learning, emerging technology, cultural and international issues and others.</li>
</ul>

### 6.1 Program and Course Development <a name="programcourse"></a>
#### Identifying E-learning Projects for Development
Some good questions to consider when thinking about the development of e-learning courses are the following:
<ul>
	<li>Where does the impetus for development come from?</li>
	<li>Are courses brought forward and developed by teachers and trainers or are courses identified by the management within the organization based upon how well they fit strategic goals?</li>
	<li>And once such courses are identified, what kind of development process is followed?</li>
	<li>Do teachers and trainers work independently to develop materials or do they work in some kind of project team?</li>
</ul>
There are no right or wrong answers to these questions. The process by which e-learning projects are initiated and how they are developed will vary and will depend on the institutional context. In this unit we will be recommending certain approaches but you need to keep in mind that these must be appropriate to your context. It is also important to note that, even within a small organization, it is likely that more than one approach may be needed

In many organizations there is no formal process used to select courses or projects to be developed for e-learning.  Neither is there any direct relationship between the people who make decisions about teaching and those who make decisions about the technical infrastructure that will, in the end, deliver courses.  In such contexts, it is very difficult to plan effectively or strategically for either teaching and learning or for implementation of e-learning infrastructure.

We are going to refer to the process used by the now defunct Distance Education and Technology department at the University of British Columbia but also draw to your attention to the planning process used by the <a href="http://blended.online.ucf.edu/" target="_blank">University of Central Florida (UCF),</a> particularly when we consider development in a mixed-mode context.  Our intention here is to show you a couple of different models and policies concerning course development, and to help you to consider scenarios that might be productive in your own context.  As well, it is important to consider the process by which projects are identified and supported within an organization, as this will determine, to a large measure, the type of development environment that is created.

### 6.2 Course Development Models <a name="models"></a>
The two most common approaches to e-learning course development are the "Do It Yourself" approach or what Bates calls the Lone Ranger approach and the Project Management approach. But these are really two ends of a continuum and there are variety of other approaches in between these two poles.

In the following readings, five models are described, although I'm not sure I would classify the open content approach as a development model since open content can be used in any of the other models.
<ol>
	<li>Lone Ranger</li>
	<li>Boutique</li>
	<li>Collegial</li>
	<li>Project Management</li>
	<li>Open Content</li>
</ol>

We take a fairly pragmatic approach to e-learning development. In most organizations, some combination of Lone Ranger and Project Management approaches is likely needed to allow for broad innovation and strategic implementation of e-learning. The following tables summarize relative advantages and disadvantages of the Lone Ranger and Project Management approach:

The key goal of a project management approach is to organize people around well-defined projects so as to produce high-quality materials as efficiently as possible. This allows e-learning to be developed and delivered in a manner that ensures that resources are used efficiently and that individual team members contribute appropriate skills and knowledge to the project.

You’ll recall the <a href="http://blogs.ubc.ca/etec520/files/2010/04/eLearning-graphic-1.jpg" target="_blank">e-learning continuum</a> that you looked at earlier in the course.  As you move from the left to the right across this  continuum, from e-learning as classroom enhancements to fully online e-learning, you also move from the realm of Lone Ranger approaches to the realm of project management approaches to development.  With the added complexity associated with fully online projects, a project management approach becomes essential in ensuring that developments are completed within agreed upon schedules and budgets.  Without such managed approaches, it becomes more and more risky for an organization to undertake large-scale e-learning.

The UBC Distance Education &amp; Technology (DET),which no longer exists, used a quasi-project management approach to course development. The Project Development Handbook is a useful resource that illustrates what a project management approach looks like in practice.

### 6.3 A Typical Project Team <a name="team"></a>
What follows is a description of the types of people that are typically brought together for a project and whose work is organized within a managed process.
#### Subject-matter Expert
The subject-matter expert is typically a faculty member with expertise in a particular academic discipline, topic, or field of practice. He or she serves as the course author and develops the content, helps to design learning activities and assessment strategies and brings  his or her experience with the challenge of teaching the content. Ideally, the subject-matter expert also goes on to teach the course at least once after it is developed.  In some distance education contexts, however, it is often the case that the original subject-matter expert is not available to teach the course, or it is designed to be taught by more than one instructor. The subject-matter expert, therefore, often plays the role as both author and instructor, or academic lead for a team of instrutors.
#### Project Manager
The Project Manager’s primary role is to support the day-to-day details of the project through the planning, development  and delivery stages. The Project Manager helps to define the project budget, negotiates a project schedule with the rest of the team, and pulls together the people who will be needed to develop the materials. The Project Manager is also responsible for tracking progress and the allocation of resources throughout the life of the project (which is most cases includes the period when a course is actually being delivered to students). The Project Manager is often also the Instructional Designer.
#### Instructional Designer
The Instructional Designer’s primary responsibility is to assist the subject-matter expert in developing high-quality, pedagogically sound learning materials. Instructional Designers typically have some background in an academic area, but are not necessarily experts in the subject area of the project, nor actively teaching.  Instructional Designers work to help subject-matter experts gain a critical awareness of the relationship between course materials, activities and assignments, and evaluation methodologies. They also play a critical role in helping everyone on the project team to negotiate the impact of media and different modes of delivery on teaching and learning relationships.
#### Media Designers
Media Designers are professionals in the design of graphics, multimedia, video or whatever media are required to support a project. Such designers have extensive skills in using development tools and authoring environments to create media for use in print, television, the web, CD ROMs or DVDs. The type of  designer needed for a project varies with the nature of the particular course and delivery context. For a course that will be developed for the web, it is quite common to have a graphic designer and multimedia designer involved. A media designer can play a very important role in helping  both subject-matter experts and instructional designers to come up with creative approaches to use media to  serve instructional ends. It is particularly productive to include such people in some of the early design conversations with subject-matter experts.
#### Web Developer
For projects that are to be delivered online, it is typical to include a web-developer on the team.  A web developer has the necessary skills to convert project documents into HTML formats for publication, and may also have expertise in using tools within a learning management system like Web CT to support presentation of material, quizzes, and site management. While faculty members are increasingly capable of of handling their own web publishing, one of the principles of a project management approach is that the expensive time of a faculty member not be used for such purposes. Web developers may also play a role in assisting with learner support, as they are well-positioned to help learners who are having technical problems with the learning environments they have programmed. Depending upon the skill level of the web developer as well as the technical needs within different projects, it is possible that web developers will also fill programming functions as well by designing java script or database integration to support dynamic web-pages.
#### Learner Support
Learner support professionals are, ideally, also available within a project team, and may play a direct role in the development of orientation and support resources tailored to support e-learning in general. They may also be called upon to develop systems to support the delivery of courses where organizational resources are inadequate to meet the need. We will be looking more closely at learner support in the last topic of this unit, but at this point, it is enough to say that learner support crosses over many roles (including administrators and teachers) to ensure effective delivery of a course. Strategies to support learners must be considered as part of the discussion when a project is being developed so as to ensure that there is a successful implementation.
#### Defining Roles and Responsibilities
While specific configuration of a project team will vary from institution to institution and, even, within and between different departments in a single institution, it is important for roles and responsibilities to be clearly defined at the start of a project. The description of roles as listed above are typically required for projects, especially more complex ones, though the particular functions may be combined in single people. Some institutions use dedicated Project Mangers while others combine the roles of Project Manager and Instructional Designer, for example.
#### Funding and Development Support
The funding approach and how development is supported in an institution will also play a role in determining what kind of core project team can be brought together. For example, in many universities it is often common for project teams to be composed of people who are hired specifically for the project (typically on part-time or limited term contracts).  Because the money that supports the project is soft, i.e., it is short-term as opposed to long-term funding, it is not typically possible to create long-term positions. This has a negative impact on continuity, as it is difficult to retain those people who have gained experience working on a project year to year. However, the flexibility of this soft-funding makes it easier to hire and support students. Another common approach to supporting the development of fully online e-learning projects is to have them resourced using a combination of professors, whose time is acquired to work on a project through buy-out or course release, with the support of a professional development group from a centre that has long-term, permanent staff. By positioning such staff in a centre or unit to support e-learning development, an institution is able to maintain a consistent level of quality resources to support on-going development year-to-year. Such a resource, however, depends upon predictable, on-going funding from the institution.

### 6.4 The Production Cycle <a name="cycle"></a>
One of the disadvantages mentioned above in relation to the Lone Ranger approach is that such projects are typically short-term and difficult to sustain over time. With a Project Management approach, a key principle is that projects take place in a cyclical and iterative process. A project is understood to have a number of phases or steps with discrete activities that need to take place, and at the end of the cycle, the process repeats, to allow for courses and projects to be refined and maintained. The graphic below provides an example of the development cycle that is used at UBC for Distance Education projects.

<a href="http://blogs.ubc.ca/etec520/files/2011/11/production-cycle.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-2163 aligncenter" src="http://blogs.ubc.ca/etec520/files/2011/11/production-cycle.png" alt="" width="432" height="225" /></a>

For a description of each phase of the development cycle, you can look at pages 57-70 of <em>Preparing Distance Education Courses: A Guide for Course Authors</em>, which is in the second section of the <a href="http://www.box.com/shared/b5tzvdlds9">DET Project Development Manual</a> from UBC.

### 6.5 Blended Approaches to E-Learning <a name="blended"></a>
Earlier in this unit we mentioned  that as one moves from the left to the right on the <a href="http://blogs.ubc.ca/etec520/files/2010/04/eLearning-graphic-1.jpg" target="_blank">e-learning continuum</a> we introduced at the beginning of the course, the level of complexity and the need for a more managed approach to planning and development increases. In the middle of this continuum, is mixed-mode teaching, a blended or hybrid approach that involves a conscious reorganization of the time that students are asked to spend in the physical classroom as well as a strategic positioning of online materials and activities to effectively support student learning in ways not possible in the physical classroom alone.

Mixed-mode approaches to teaching are closely related to the concept of distributed learning (as distinct from  distance learning). Carol Twigg (2001) offers the following description of distributed learning which is still quite useful:

<em>“Distributed learning encompasses both on and off-campus online teaching and learning. The term had its origins in the networking community, where experts talk about distributed intelligence of the mainframe computer. The term suggests that learning is being distributed throughout the network.  Consequently, the kind of either/or (on/off-campus) distinction that the term ‘distance learning’ suggests is no longer appropriate.”</em>

Mixed-mode instruction, holds a lot of potential for educational institutions as it allows for both new efficiencies in the organization of limited space on campuses as well as positive transformations in the manner in which students are asked to interact with content and with one another on-campus and online. In other words, mixed-mode approaches can potentially help to solve bottle-necks relating to access to campus resources as well as provide creative and innovative approaches to enriching the learning environment.

#### Modes of Delivery at the University of Central Florida
We are going to focus our discussion of mixed-mode courses and the development implications that arise from such development by looking at an American university, the University of Central Florida (UCF). UCF is an interesting institution in terms of e-learning strategies, as it has consciously identified institutional goals that it is working to achieve through the provision of different forms of e-learning. At the same time as UCF is providing enhancements to existing on-campus courses, they have identified a goal to reduce the amount of time students need to spend on-campus by developing mixed-mode courses. They have also tied access to funding to faculty development initiatives. Faculty members who want to gain access to the resources to develop e-learning courses (either mixed mode or online), must first complete a post-graduate level training course, IDL 6543: Interactive Distributed Learning for Technology-Mediated Course Delivery.

The funding and resource models UCF uses are intended to provide support for the different kinds of delivery modes they use, e.g. Enhanced, Reduced Seat and World Wide Web.  We will explain these delivery modes below, and the readings you are asked to review provide more information on the resource implications that follow from the different modes. We are not as interested in the manner in which they support a particular mode (in terms of the type of development team that needs to be assembled around a particular project); instead, we are more interested in how a large institution has established strategic goals to improve access to its programs by carefully organizing the modes of delivery it would use to take best advantage of the different e-learning technologies it has at its disposal.

In order to deal with a dramatic increase in student demand for access to its programs but, at the same time, an on-going need to provide greater flexibility to students who were working full-time or had difficulty accessing campus, UCF came up with a plan to offer its programs using three modes:

<strong>Enhanced with media/electronic mail (E):</strong> Courses are enhanced with the WWW or other electronic media-based materials. These courses do not reduce seat time with electronic instruction.

<strong>Reduced seat time/mixed-mode (M):</strong> Courses require electronic media-based instruction that substitutes for some classroom time (reduced seat time). These courses have regular live meeting times. Students must have access to the Internet, a Web browser such as Netscape, basic Web browsing knowledge, ability to use e-mail, and basic computer skills such as word processing.

<strong>World Wide Web (W):</strong>  These are fully online courses that students study off campus and require students to their own computers and Internet access.

#### The UBC Flexible Learning Initiative
UBC recently launched its <a href="http://flexible.learning.ubc.ca/" target="_blank">Flexible Learning Initiative </a>which is aimed at using technology to enable pedagogical and logistical flexibility. The initiative has three goals:
<ol start="1">
	<li>Enhance educational outcomes for students, building on existing UBC expertise and strengths;</li>
	<li>Enable greater access to UBC learning;</li>
	<li>Improve university operating effectiveness through new learning models.</li>
</ol>
The flexible strategy, <a href="http://flexible-learning2015.sites.olt.ubc.ca/files/2015/04/fl_strategy_september_2014.pdf" target="_blank">Flexible Learning: Charting a Strategic Vision for UBC (Vancouver Campus) </a>was released in September 2014. This is a document worth reading and it charts a course for a strategic institutional initiative that has high level support and funding to the tune of $5 million.

### 6.6 Conclusion <a name="conclusion"></a>
In most Western universities and colleges, professors and instructors have a great deal of autonomy, which gives them freedom to chose both content and method of teaching. If teachers wish to work alone in their use of technology for teaching, this will take up a great deal more of their time. Also, working alone runs a very high risk of developing relatively poor quality courses. The alternative, working in a team in a project management model, may reduce the overall independence of instructors, but it provides technical support and a structure that enables them to control their time. Even more importantly, working with a team of professionals in a project management model is likely to increase the quality of the teaching and learning.

Nevertheless, project management is not always the best or most cost-effective model. Where technology is being used as a classroom aid, a project management model may not be necessary, but even in this context, instructors are likely to need and welcome technical help and support. Also, there are dangers that a managerial approach to teaching, through 'top-down' strategic planning and project management, will not only be resisted by instructors, but may be too rigid or structured for a fast-changing environment.

So, whether working as Lone Rangers or in a project team, instructors are going to need more institutional support if e-learning is to be successfully integrated into teaching. Teaching with new technologies is likely to be successful only if there is institutional support and mechanisms and infrastructure put in place that support the use of technology across an institution.

To conclude this course, we highly recommend one last reading. This is another article by Sarah Guri-Rosenblit who identifies and explains what she considers to be eight inherent paradoxes that higher education institutions face as they try to implement e-learning.
