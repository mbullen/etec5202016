### Unit 1 Discussion: The Meaning of E-Learning
After you have read about the e-learning continuum and the other frameworks and perspectives of e-learning, share your thoughts and reactions. Here are some questions to get you thinking but don't feel compelled to answer them all:
<ol>
	<li>Have they changed your view of what e-learning is?</li>
	<li>Do you think these perspectives and frameworks adequately describe the concept?</li>
	<li>What, if anything, has been left out by these frameworks?</li>
	<li>What do you think about our point about e-learning being more than simply using technology to enhance existing teaching approaches?</li>
	<li>Sinclair et al. propose what is probably the most radical conception of e-learning. What is your reaction to this? How realistic do you think it is?</li>
	<li>What do you think of the three distinctive differences between e-learning and distance education identified by Guri-Rosenblit?</li>
	<li>What kind of e-learning is most relevant to you?</li>
</ol>

### Unit 3 Discussion: Supporting E-Learning
Choose a post secondary institution and find out as much as you can about how it is supporting e-learning. Look for the following kind of information:
<ul>
	<li>organizational structure</li>
	<li>funding</li>
	<li>learner support</li>
	<li>faculty support</li>
	<li>technology infrastructure</li>
</ul>
Search the institutional website using terms such as “e-learning”, “learning technology”, “distance education”, “distributed learning” “faculty development” etc.

Many of you have already collected a lot of this information for assignment 1 so feel free to use this, add to it, or look at different institutions.

Consider the following questions:
<ul>
	<li>What conclusions can you draw about how this university is organized to support e-learning?</li>
	<li>What recommendations would you make to this institution about how to support e-learning?</li>
</ul>
Here are some suggested institutions but feel free to choose others or stick with the ones you used for assignment 1:
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.olt.ubc.ca/" target="_blank">University of British Columbia</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://tlc.ucalgary.ca/elearning" target="_blank">University of Calgary</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://ctl.ualberta.ca/" target="_blank">University of Alberta</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.bcit.ca/ltc" target="_blank">British Columbia Institute of Technology</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://cte.uwaterloo.ca/teaching_with_technology/index.html" target="_blank">University of Waterloo</a></li>
</ul>

### Unit 4 Discussion: E-Learning Strategies
Below are two examples of strategic plans for eLearning that were developed in 2012. The first is a departmental/school/faculty strategic plan for eLearning from a postsecondary institution. The second is a draft institutional strategic plan for the British Columbia Institute of Technology.

Read both of these plans critically and post your comments to the discussion forum.

You may also want to read the article, <em>Revisiting the Need for Strategic Planning for eLearning in Higher Education</em> which is based on the eLearning strategy planning process used at BCIT.

### Unit 5 Discussion: Government Strategies
In this dicussion, I would like you to consider the the three categories of government strategies for e-learning that we have examined: conservative strategies, radical strategies and funding strategies.

Consider the following questions:
<ol>
	<li>In the region where you live, what evidence have you seen of these strategies?</li>
	<li>Are governments using them alone, in combination?</li>
	<li>What is your sense of the effectiveness of the strategies?</li>
	<li>What issues are being addressed by the strategies?</li>
</ol>

### Unit 6 Discussion: Approaches to Course & Program Development
After you've read the section on approaches to course development and the related readings, share your reactions to this material.
<ol>
	<li>What do you think about what Bates says about the lone ranger approach? We take a very strong position on this issue and argue that, while there is a place for different approaches, to develop and deliver high quality, cost effective and sustainable e-learning as distance education requires a project management approach. What is your view?</li>
	<li>Do you think it is possible to achieve these goals with other approaches?</li>
	<li>How feasible do you think it is to use a managerial approach in educational institutions, like universities, which do not have a managerial organizational culture?<strong> Please try to keep your postings to around 300 words or less.</strong></li>
</ol>
