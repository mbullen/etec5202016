While the course content is on this site, the online discussions will take place in Blackboard Connect. We do this for two reasons. First, the discussion forum capabilities of Blackboard Connect (threading, nesting, sorting, displaying etc.) are much more sophisticated than what is available in Word Press. Secondly, the Blackboard Connect discussion forums are restricted to registered students only so you have a certain degree of privacy. This allows us to keep the course content open to the world, but restrict access to the discussions.

There will be a number of different forums for discussion and interaction and sharing of information. These include:

<strong>Student Cafe:</strong> for social interaction<strong>
Announcements:</strong> for course updates, changes and announcements of relevant events or publications etc.<strong>
Unit Discussion Forums:</strong> for discussion of issues related to the specific units. There will separate unit discussion forums for each section of the course.

### Guidelines for Participation
The discussions are an essential part of the course and we expect you to participate regularly by reading the discussions and contributing to them. You should check in to the discussions<strong> at least three times per week</strong> and contribute <strong>at least two messages to each discussion</strong>. We also expect you to follow up any responses to your contributions.

We expect you to respond to the topic, issue or question with comments that are considered, and that reflect your personal opinions, experiences, and knowledge. Where appropriate, your comments should take into account the relevant course readings. Feel free to quote readings you feel might be of interest to others in your group. Try to remain focused on the topic and adhere to the recommended maximum length for postings <strong>(approximately 500 words).</strong>

The discussions  provide you with an opportunity to share your knowledge, to seek feedback from fellow students as well as instructors on your ideas, and to ask for help when you need it. The discussions should also help you in the preparation of your assignments as they topics are closely related to the assignments.

Each post should:
<ul>
	<li>add to the discussion;</li>
	<li>try bring about a new way of looking at the issues being raised;</li>
	<li>if possible, incorporate the readings or other academic sources (quoting small passages is acceptable - try to limit quotes to no more than three or four lines);</li>
	<li>add but not be limited to, the experiences of the writer in design and development situations. (Responses that say more than "I  agree with that..." or "same for me..." are expected);</li>
	<li>encourage the continuation of the discussion; respect the point-of-view of the other students, allowing for the discussion of different points-of-view without judgment.</li>
</ul><hr/>
### Discussion Topics
#### Unit 1: The Meaning of E-Learning
After you have read about the e-learning continuum and the other frameworks and perspectives of e-learning, share your thoughts and reactions. Here are some questions to get you thinking but don't feel compelled to answer them all:
<ol>
	<li>Have they changed your view of what e-learning is?</li>
	<li>Do you think these perspectives and frameworks adequately describe the concept?</li>
	<li>What, if anything, has been left out by these frameworks?</li>
	<li>What do you think about our point about e-learning being more than simply using technology to enhance existing teaching approaches?</li>
	<li>Sinclair et al. propose what is probably the most radical conception of e-learning. What is your reaction to this? How realistic do you think it is?</li>
	<li>What do you think of the three distinctive differences between e-learning and distance education identified by Guri-Rosenblit?</li>
	<li>What kind of e-learning is most relevant to you?</li>
</ol>

#### Unit 3: Supporting E-Learning
Choose a post secondary institution and find out as much as you can about how it is supporting e-learning. Look for the following kind of information:
<ul>
	<li>organizational structure</li>
	<li>funding</li>
	<li>learner support</li>
	<li>faculty support</li>
	<li>technology infrastructure</li>
</ul>
Search the institutional website using terms such as “e-learning”, “learning technology”, “distance education”, “distributed learning” “faculty development” etc.

Many of you have already collected a lot of this information for assignment 1 so feel free to use this, add to it, or look at different institutions.

Consider the following questions:
<ul>
	<li>What conclusions can you draw about how this university is organized to support e-learning?</li>
	<li>What recommendations would you make to this institution about how to support e-learning?</li>
</ul>
Here are some suggested institutions but feel free to choose others or stick with the ones you used for assignment 1:
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.olt.ubc.ca/" target="_blank">University of British Columbia</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://tlc.ucalgary.ca/elearning" target="_blank">University of Calgary</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://ctl.ualberta.ca/" target="_blank">University of Alberta</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.bcit.ca/ltc" target="_blank">British Columbia Institute of Technology</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://cte.uwaterloo.ca/teaching_with_technology/index.html" target="_blank">University of Waterloo</a></li>
</ul>

#### Unit 4: E-Learning Strategies
Below are two examples of strategic plans for eLearning that were developed in 2012. The first is a departmental/school/faculty strategic plan for eLearning from a postsecondary institution. The second is a draft institutional strategic plan for the British Columbia Institute of Technology.

Read both of these plans critically and post your comments to the discussion forum.

You may also want to read the article, <em>Revisiting the Need for Strategic Planning for eLearning in Higher Education</em> which is based on the eLearning strategy planning process used at BCIT.

#### Unit 5: Government Strategies
In this dicussion, I would like you to consider the the three categories of government strategies for e-learning that we have examined: conservative strategies, radical strategies and funding strategies.

Consider the following questions:
<ol>
	<li>In the region where you live, what evidence have you seen of these strategies?</li>
	<li>Are governments using them alone, in combination?</li>
	<li>What is your sense of the effectiveness of the strategies?</li>
	<li>What issues are being addressed by the strategies?</li>
</ol>

#### Unit 6: Approaches to Course & Program Development
After you've read the section on approaches to course development and the related readings, share your reactions to this material.
<ol>
	<li>What do you think about what Bates says about the lone ranger approach? We take a very strong position on this issue and argue that, while there is a place for different approaches, to develop and deliver high quality, cost effective and sustainable e-learning as distance education requires a project management approach. What is your view?</li>
	<li>Do you think it is possible to achieve these goals with other approaches?</li>
	<li>How feasible do you think it is to use a managerial approach in educational institutions, like universities, which do not have a managerial organizational culture?<strong> Please try to keep your postings to around 300 words or less.</strong></li>
</ol>
