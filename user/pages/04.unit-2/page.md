<hr/>
In this unit we start to get at the "meat" of the course: what  organizations need to do to get ready for e-learning. E-learning is a costly endeavour and unless organizations prepare adequately before implementing it they will not reap its full benefits. The key readiness issues include:

* Costs and funding
* IT infrastructure
* Organizational culture
* Planning
* Faculty readiness
* Learner readiness
* Organizational structure

With a proper understanding of the key readiness factors, you should be able to asses your own organization to determine how ready it is for e-learning.

### Key Points <a name="keypoints"></a>
Too often e-learning readiness is viewed in strictly technical terms. Does the organization have the necessary technical infrastructure? Does it have a learning management system?  Sufficient bandwidth? But if there is one key point we would like you take away from this unit, it is that e-learning readiness is much more than just a technical issue. It is a multi-faceted issue that encompasses a wide range of organizational, pedagogical and administrative factors as well as the technical issues. Ideally, the first step in implementing e-learning in an organization will be an assessment of that organization's readiness. The key readiness issues include:
<ul>
	<li>Funding</li>
	<li>IT infrastructure</li>
	<li>Organizational culture</li>
	<li>Planning</li>
	<li>Faculty and learner readiness</li>
	<li>Organizational structure</li>
</ul>

### 2.1 Cost & Funding <a name="costs"></a>
<p style="text-align: left;">E-learning is not cheap. No matter what model is used to support it, in the short term, extra funding or reallocated funding will be needed if e-learning is implemented on a wide scale. The good news is that if e-learning is implemented properly, there can be cost savings or cost efficiencies in the longer term. However, in order to implement e-learning successfully, organizations need to decide how it will be funded and how that funding will be sustained. Many organizations launch e-learning initiatives with one-time start up funding without considering how the programs created will be sustained. Funding is a key readiness issue that organizations need to examine carefully. In order to make sound decisions about funding e-learning we need to have a good understanding of what it actually costs and what the benefits are. As you will read in chapter 7 of Bates &amp; Sangrà, our higher education institutions have very little understanding of the cost issues.</p>
Based on their analysis of 11 post secondary institutions, Bates &amp; Sangrà make five recommendations related to costs and funding of e-learning:

<strong>1. Know What is Being Done</strong>

They argue that institutions do not know enough about how instructors use their time in teaching and how this affects costs. E-learning has a great potential to increase productivity but in order to do that institutions need to change their approaches to course development and delivery and how financial data is organized and reported.

<strong>2. Change How Costs are Tracked</strong>

They recommend a shift to an activity-based accounting model where costs and revenues are tied directly to programs.

<strong>3. Develop a Clear Funding Strategy</strong>

Investment in e-learning should be explicitly linked to the replacement of existing practices. Where the savings will be made to cover the additional costs of e-learning needs to be clearly identified.

<strong>4. Link Costs to Benefits</strong>

Current practice at most post secondary institutions is to use e-learning in an "add-on" approach. That means existing teaching approaches, funding models, hiring practices, workload allocations etc. remain unchanged but e-learning is added to the mix. There is rarely any serious attempt to measure the benefits of the use of technology. The goals for e-learning need to be clearly identified, measured and related to costs.

<strong>5. Make Business Plans Part of Program Planning</strong>

Business plans allow us to identify the costs of developing and delivering a program and to identify the risks. More importantly they allows us to track and compare the costs of different modes of delivery and they provide us with important data for doing cost-benefit analyses.

These ideas are explained in more detail in chapter 7 of Bates &amp; Sangrà.

#### Guiding Questions

Use the following questions to guide your thinking about the funding issues:
<ol>
	<li>You are the Vice-President, Academic, of your institution. You need $500,000 to set up an educational technology centre to meet the growing demand from faculty for support. Could you find an area within your budget responsibility where you could justify reducing costs to pay for the new centre? Even if you think closing a department would not seriously damage the mission of the institution as a whole, would you be able to close it, given your union agreements? Could you achieve the same results by re-organizing existing departments? Is there somewhere else in the university's budget from where you might be able to persuade others to release that kind of money?</li>
	<li>Bates &amp; Sangrà argue strongly in favour of activity-based accounting in which revenues flow directly to the programs that generate them rather to a central institutional institutional account. While I understand the logic of this, I have serious concerns about what it might do to the institiution's identity and financial flexibility. Do you think this might reduce a college or university to a loosely organized group of independent business units without any overriding institutional purpose? What about the impact on its ability to support activities that don't fit neatly into one school or faculty?</li>
	<li style="text-align: left;">As you can see from the business model example in chapter 7 of Bates &amp; Sangrà, the MET is self-funded through tuition fees. Should institutions focus on markets where e-learning can pay for itself, or should senior administrators ensure that all students, including state-subsidized undergraduates, have access to e-learning, even if this means closing some face-to-face programs to find the money? Are there other choices?</li>
</ol>

### 2.2 IT Infrastructure & Support <a name="it"></a>
#### Infrastructure
<p style="text-align: left;">IT infrastructure is a critical readiness issue for organizations. What is needed will depend, of course, on the scale of the proposed e-learning implementation and the approach used. For example, if an organization decides to deploy an enterprise-wide learning management system, clearly there must be sufficient human and technical resources to support this in the organization. As well, the organization must have sufficient band-width to allow students to access the learning management system reliably and with reasonable speed. Keep in mind, too, that it's not just the institutional IT infrastructure that matters if you are dealing with distance students. If some or all of your students are accessing e-learning from off campus, you need to think about what kind of technical access they have. In all aspects of planning for e-learning you need to remember who your audience is.</p>
Implementing e-learning doesn't necessarily require the use of an enterprise level learning management system and there are growing doubts about the effectiveness of this approach, particularly for smaller organizations. Alternatives include outsourcing the learning management system so that there are limited requirements for in-house technical support and infrastructure. Another option is not to use a learning management system at all and instead make use of the wide variety of free e-learning tools that are available.

The following video discusses some of the shortcomings of the learning management system and examines an alternative , "do it yourself" approach.
<p style="text-align: center;"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/98760410" width="500" height="281" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>

#### Technical Support
Another issue that needs to be addressed is technical support. The hardware and software is certainly much more user friendly than it used to be and faculty and students tend have more IT skills than they used to, but there is still a need for technical support. Things do break down and skill levels vary considerably among faculty and students.

The traditional model of institutional IT support is a centralized department that is only open from 9-5 on weekdays and is usually situated in a remote part of the campus. This will not be sufficient if you are planning a wide-scale implementation of e-learning and you expect a significant proportion of your faculty and students to be using e-learning. They will need to have more accessible support which means it needs to be available after hours. Although most support can be provided remotely, there are times when it is just easier to talk to somebody face-to-face. In this case, the support should be in a relatively accessible location. Now, providing support after hours doesn't necessarily mean 24/7 support but it does mean more than 9-5. The key thing is to try to get some idea of what the support needs are and plan accordingly. For example, if you are delivering a lot of fully online courses to working students, chances are they will be studying in the evenings and on weekends. It would be important, then, to provide some level of support at these times.

### 2.3 Organizational Culture <a name="orgculture"></a>
All organizations have some basic, shared assumptions, values, and norms. This is what is called an organizational culture which is essentially the personality of an organizaiton. Organizational culture is expressed in how its members behave, how the organization promotes itself and what it values and rewards. So why does this matter to how we plan and manage e-learning? Well, as Bates &amp; Sangrà (2011) argue, organizational cultures develop to protect the core mission of an organization which means any changes that are perceived to undermine the core mission and values are often resisted because they are seen as threatening.

Bergquist and Pawlak (2008) have written extensively on the organizational culture and higher education. In their book, <a href="http://www.amazon.ca/Engaging-Six-Cultures-Academy-Expanded/dp/0787995193" target="_blank"><em>Engaging the Six Cultures of the Academy</em></a>, they argue life in conventional universities is governed by six distinct but related organizational cultures that are often operating simultaneously. They argue that these cultures profoundly affect how faculty, staff, students and administrators view and carry out their roles and how the institutions are organized. They call the six cultures collegial, managerial, developmental, negotiated, virtual and tangible.
#### The Collegial Culture
In the collegial culture the autonomous faculty member reigns supreme. She or he is driven by the pursuit of knowledge. The notions of measurable outcomes and accountability are resisted and academic freedom is the guiding principle. Governance processes are faculty-driven and controlled and institutional change takes place slowly. “For all its strengths—specifically, its encouragement of deliberation and open communication—the collegial culture suffers from a lack of organization and coherence” (Bergquist &amp; Pawlak, 2008, p. 73).
#### The Managerial Culture
The managerial culture is defined primarily in structural terms. Work is organized and directed toward specific goals. Evaluation and accountability are highly valued as are fiscal responsibility and effective supervisory skills. The managerial culture has its origins in the world of business and anybody who has worked in a corporate environment will recognize its characteristics. However it has also had a profound impact on college and university campuses. Governments have increasingly demanded greater accountability from public universities and colleges (at the same time as they reduced funding) which forced these institutions to engage in the kind of planning and organization that is commonplace in business but largely foreign to the collegial culture.
#### The Developmental Culture
The developmental culture values the cognitive, affective and behavioral growth of students, faculty and staff. It finds meaning in the development of programs and activities that focus on personal and professional growth. “It holds untested assumptions about the inherent desire of all men and women to attain their own personal maturation, while helping others in the institution become more mature” (Bergquist &amp; Pawlak, 2008, p. 73)
#### The Negotiating Culture
This is a culture that sees university life as consisting of diverse interest groups who must negotiate with each other in order to receive their fair share of the resources and benefits of the institutions. It “values confrontation and fair bargaining among constituencies (primarily management and faculty or staff) with vested interests that are inherently in opposition;…and that conceives of the institution’s enterprise as either the undesirable promulgation of existing (and often repressive) social attitudes and structures or the establishment of new and more liberating social attitudes and structures” (Bergquist &amp; Pawlak, 2008, p. 111).
#### The Virtual Culture
The virtual culture is in many ways the most radical of the six cultures as it represents a significant change in the role of higher education in a globalized world. It is a direct result of the “digital revolution”, the increasing use and importance of digital technologies in our daily lives. The virtual culture positions higher education in a global context in a postmodern world that “values open, shared, responsive, educational systems; that holds assumptions about its ability to make sense of the fragmentation and ambiguity that exists…and that conceives of the institution’s enterprise as linking its educational resources to global and technological resources, thus broadening the global learning network” (Bergquist &amp; Pawlak, 2008, p. 147).
#### The Tangible Culture
The tangible culture is a return to the roots of higher education. In reacting to the rise of the virtual culture, the tangible culture “values the predictability of a value-based, face-to-face education in an owned physical location; that holds assumptions about the ability of old systems and technologies being able to instill the institution’s values; and that conceives of the institution’s enterprise as the honoring and reintegration of learning from a local perspective.” (Berquist &amp; Pawlak, 2008, p. 185)

If you are interested in learning more about these six cultures, you should get a copy of the Bergquist &amp; Pawlak book. For our purposes, however, the collegial and the managerial cultures are the most relevant. Academic life in most western universities is firmly embedded in the collegial culture. However, many of the practices and structures associated with e-learning are informed by a managerial culture. For this reason we want to examine these two organizational cultures, how they interact and the challenges this creates for the effective implementation of e-learning.
#### Questions
<ol>
	<li>Does the description of the organizational cultures of higher education provided by Berquist &amp; Pawlak makes sense to you? Do you see any evidence of these cultures within your own institutions?</li>
	<li>We have suggested that the collegial culture is the dominant culture of North American higher education. Do you agree with this?</li>
	<li>Do you think organizational culture really matters as we consider the planning and management of e-learning?</li>
	<li>Do you think that large research universities are capable of changing enough to make e-learning a significant and sustainable part of their teaching? What are your reasons?</li>
</ol>

### 2.4 The Impact of Organizational Culture <a name="cultureimpact"></a>
#### Cultural Conflict
While multiple cultures co-exist in most universities, the collegial culture still tends to provide the lens through which university faculty see their world. It is a culture that values independence and autonomy and eschews direction and accountability. As Bergquist &amp; Pawlak (2008) observe,

<em>"for many faculty members, one of the most attractive features of the collegial culture is this tolerance for and even encouragement of autonomous activity. Whereas the other three academic cultures…reinforce collaboration and corporate activity, the collegial culture nurtures the ‘lone wolf’, the ‘eccentric’, and the socially oblivious ‘absent-minded professor’ in a manner that is unique to American higher education." (p. 32).</em>

Thus we have two groups of people with differing realities and a disconnect between two fundamentally different cultures: the faculty members who inhabit the collegial world and the e-learning support staff who usually live in the managerial world. This sets up the conditions for conflict and potential resistance to the implementation of e-learning in a cost-effective and sustainable manner.

Some degree of conflict and resistance, then, is probably inevitable as higher education institutions try to use more managerial approaches. However, this does not mean that successful implementation of e-learning is unachievable.

#### Linking E-Learning Support Units with Academic Departments
To mitigate the potential for cultural conflict, t is essential to forge strong relationships between e-learning support units and academic departments and faculties. These relationships must extend beyond individual faculty members to the senior, decision-making levels. Faculties have to feel that they have ownership and control over e-learning. This means making the key academic decisions and setting priorities. Deans and Associate Deans must be aware of the e-learning activity in their faculties, understand how it contributes to their missions, and how they benefit financially and academically by participating in e-learning projects. If e-learning is seen as something that happens somewhere else, that faculties do not control, it is more likely to be ignored or resisted. There are a number of ways of achieving this and they will vary depending on the particular university context. Advisory committees that have faculty representation and that meet regularly to discuss e-learning issues, set priorities, and allocate resources are an excellent way to ensure that faculties are involved. However more is needed. E-learning has to become part of the fabric of the faculty, not an optional extra that only a few enthusiasts engage in. Development and teaching of e-learning courses need to be part of the regular faculty load. Achieving this will require working with Deans and Associate Deans to educate them about what e-learning is and how it can contribute to the academic plans of the faculties.

#### Adapting to the Collegial Culture
If an e-learning support unit already exists, it must resist the temptation to assume the way they do things is the only way. Highly centralized, professionalized support units that tend to treat e-learning development as an industrial process will be resisted by many faculty members because this approach is not consistent with their world view. According to Bergquist &amp; Pawlak (2008), faculty members who adhere to collegial cultural norms are dismissive of the systematic planning processes and rationalistic world view of managerial approaches.

Even though the classroom is essentially a public arena, faculty members tend to view teaching as a private interchange between them and their students. There is a strong resistance to the observation of their teaching or the idea that teaching can be improved through sharing experiences and developmental activities. Millet’s (1962) observations from over 40 years ago still ring true,

<em>"the scholar wants to be left alone in the conduct of the academic enterprise. He does not welcome innovation in instructional procedures, in instructional arrangements, or in the organization and operation of a college or university…The scholar is conservative in his attitude toward and appreciation of the academic process.” </em>(p. 104).

Bates &amp; Sangrà (2011) present the issue in simpler terms. The dominant collegial culture of universities places high value on research and views teaching as secondary and something that doesn't really require training. As a result, faculty are not motivated to focus their energy on teaching or on rocking the boat by trying to change the dominant transmission mode of teaching. Thus, trying to implement e-learning on a wide scale runs up against significant barriers.

Research universities aren't the only institutions that face these barriers. One would think that colleges and other higher education institutions that place a greater emphasis on teaching would be more amendable to educational innovation. The organizational culture explanation may not be relevant here but if it isn't, how do we explain the resistance in colleges? Unfortunately Bates &amp; Sangrà don't offer us much. Their solution for the situation in universities is to provide systematic training in teaching and teaching with technology to faculty. This is certainly also relevant to colleges but will this be enough?

### 2.5 Faculty & Learner Readiness <a name="facultylearner"></a>
#### Faculty Readiness
Using e-learning, whether it is in a school, training or higher education context, requires new knowledge and skill sets and adds complexity to the work of instructors. As Bates &amp; Sangrà point out, "It is very difficult if not impossible for instructors to innovate or teach differently from the historical or mythical model if they have no understanding of possible alternative ways to teach, based on their and research" (p. 190).

Using e-learning effectively requires both technical and pedagogical skills. Too often faculty readiness for e-learning focuses almost exclusively on the technical skills when, in fact, these are relatively minor when compared to the pedagogical. Ideally faculty will have enough technical support to allow them to focus on the pedagogical issues. However they will still need to know how to use the various tools that are being deployed to deliver e-learning. Beyond the basic IT skills of using a computer, email and a browser, faculty will probably need to know the basics of using a learning management system as well as blogs and possibly wikis and social media.

However, it is the pedagogical skills that should be the focus of faculty readiness and because of the way research universities are organized and faculty are hired, this will probably require some faculty training. Bates &amp; Sangrà provide some very concrete and prescriptive recommendations for a systematic approach that goes far beyond the typical training in how to use the tools:

<em>"The use of technology needs to be combined with an understanding of how students learn, how skills and competencies are developed, how knowledge is represented through different media and then processed and how learners use different senses for learning. It means examining different approaches to learning, such as the construction of knowledge compared with a transmissive model of teaching, and how technology best works with either approach</em>" (p. 195).

They recommend a one-year, intensive, mandatory, pre-service training program that covers the following topics:
<ul>
	<li>Epistemology</li>
	<li>The biological basis of learning</li>
	<li>Learning theories</li>
	<li>The design of teaching</li>
	<li>Learning technologies</li>
	<li>Project work related to the design and delivery of an e-learning course</li>
	<li>Electives that might include courses on research in teaching and learning, emerging technology, cultural and international issues and others.</li>
</ul>
In addition to faculty training, Bates &amp; Sangrà call for training of middle and senior level managers so they are better equipped to make decisions related to educational technology and e-learning.

<a href="http://blogs.ubc.ca/etec5202015/files/2010/04/reading-icon.png"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-3032" src="http://blogs.ubc.ca/etec5202015/files/2010/04/reading-icon.png" alt="reading icon" width="80" height="104" /></a> | Bates, A.W. &amp; Sangrà, A.

The optional chapter by Wilson (2007) provides a broader perspective on faculty development for e-learning by reviewing the approaches used at a number of different institutions. The strategies include focusing on the characteristic of the innovation, adopting a staged approach to skills acquisition, embedding skills and processes associated with teaching and learning in the e-learning context in formal, accredited courses; fostering peer learning; framing faculty development as project-based learning; and using the online environment to deliver faculty development.
#### Learner Readiness
All too often we overlook the issue of learner readiness and assume that today's students are so tech savvy that they won't need any help using new learning technologies and navigating e-learning environments. The digital natives discourse has done a lot to perpetuate this idea but the r<a href="http://netgenskeptic.org/">esearch shows that the notion of the digitally literate learner </a>is largely a myth. While today's learners may have many technology skills and be proficient users of smart phones and other devices, they are not necessarily equipped with the skills needed to learn in online environments and to use the new technologies for educational purposes. But learner readiness, too, goes much further than just ensuring that students have the technical skills. As Moisey &amp; Hughes (2014) point out, learner readiness encompasses a wide range of cognitive, metacognitive, technical, administrative and programmatic support:

<em>"A constellation of resources and array of services are required to support the online learner in a manner that acknowledges individual differences and addresses them in the design of learner support services. Depending on the nature of the organization – a mega-university, a dedicated distance learning institution, or a dual-mode institution – the manner in which services and supports are provided may vary. But the aim remains the same: to provide an ideal learning environment that promotes the learner’s independence while facilitating the learning process with supports that are flexible, accessible, and readily available when needed" (p. 437).</em>

The following are readiness surveys for instructors and students that will give you an idea of what some of the basic skills are for both groups. Take a look at them and do your own readiness self-assessment:

#### Additional Reading

### 2.6 Planning <a name="planning"></a>
The conventional wisdom around e-learning is that for it to be sustainable and cost-effective there must be an institutional strategic plan for e-learning which is nested within the institution’s overall strategic plan. As I mentioned in the introduction, when I started teaching this course, I subscribed wholeheartedly to this view. But, over the years, my thinking has changed. My experience working in and with different institutions has led me to the conclusion that strategic planning for e-learning may not be necessary in all cases and may not produce the results that proponents think it will. Certainly an institutional e-learning strategy is not a precondition for e-learning as there are many examples of organizations that are using e-learning quite successfully without one. Now I haven't rejected strategic planning for e-learning but I do think we need to be much more flexible in our thinking about this and accept that different contexts demand different approaches.

In a later unit we will examine planning in more detail and look at the components of a strategic plan and the steps in the strategic planning process. For the time being, we just want to highlight the value of proper planning but caution you to be pragmatic and flexible about how you approach planning. Like so much in education, context matters. Large organizations that want to implement system-wide e-learning are going to find it much more useful to develop a strategic plan for e-learning than a small organization that may just want to offer a few online courses or encourage their teachers to make more use of technology in their teaching. Just because you don't have a fully-developed e-learning strategy doesn't necessarily mean you aren't ready for e-learning.

### 2.7 Organizational Structure <a name="orgstructure"></a>
Institutions must have the appropriate organizational structures and governance mechanisms in place to ensure that e-learning is properly implemented. Bates &amp; Sangrà (2011) stress that the successful implementation of e-learning <em>“requires daily and continuous attention throughout the organization…[and]…ongoing mechanisms in place to deal with technology issues as they arise” (</em>p. 103).

We will cover organizational structure in more detail in a later unit. For now, we highlight the two key components of organizational structure:
<ol>
	<li>Where e-learning fits in the organization and the reporting structure of the organization, e.g., does it reside in the portfolio of one of the senior administrators? Is it located on the academic/educational side of the organization or on the technical or administrative side? and</li>
	<li>How is the support provided, e.g., is there centralized support unit, does each Faculty, School or Department provide its own support, or is it basically a "do it yourself" model in which faculty or teachers are on their own to figure things out and find the support they need?</li>
</ol>
Clearly, it helps if e-learning is situated in the academic/educational portfolio as this is where the power lies in all academic organizations. However, the ideal organizational arrangement depends on how e-learning is going to be used and how widespread the proposed implementation will be. For large scale, institution-wide implementations of e-learning, well-funded, centralized support is essential. This may take the form of a centralized department that services the entire organization or, in very large institutions, it could take the form of large, well-funded centres that are based in each Faculty or school.

Related to the structural issues is the question of who is supporting and championing e-learning in the organization. It's one thing to have the e-learning department strongly embedded in the organization and well-represented on governance committees and councils but it is also important that there are powerful e-learning champions within the organization These should be people with power and influence who are not seen has having a vested interest.

### 2.8 Assessing Readiness for E-Learning <a name="assessing"></a>
Now that you have an overview of the key readiness factors, you should be able to assess the readiness of an organization. Bates &amp; Sangrà have researched this issue by examining in depth how 11 different institutions have handled the implementation of e-learning. Based on their review they developed a set of nine criteria for assessing the success of learning technology integration. With some modifications, I think these can also be used to assess the the readiness of an institution for e-learning. These criteria are discussed fully on pp. 71-75 of Bates &amp; Sangrà. I have modified them slightly here to focus more specifically on e-learning readiness.
<ol>
	<li>Are there “champions” with power and influence in the institution who recognize the importance of e-learning?</li>
	<li>Does the institution have an advanced, comprehensive IT infrastructure that enables all staff, students, and faculty to access computers, networks, software, and services as required.</li>
	<li>Have the institutional administrative systems been digitized and do faculty, staff and students have access to those services via the Internet?</li>
	<li>Does the institution have an e-learning strategy or a clear, strategic rationale for the use of e-learning?</li>
	<li>Has the institution provided adequate financial support for e-learning?</li>
	<li>Are faculty, staff and students ready to use e-learning?</li>
	<li>How comprehensive is faculty support and training for e-learning?</li>
	<li>Does the institution have an organizational culture that is conducive to e-learning?</li>
</ol>
Davis, Little and Stewart (2014) provide another perspective on some of the key readiness issues in their chapter, <em>Developing an Infrastructure of Online Learning</em>.  While they focus specifically on developing an appropriate infrastructure for <strong>online learning, </strong>much of what they have to say would apply to e-learning readiness.

The 2013 EDUCAUSE report, <em>The State of E-learning Higher Education </em>reports on a survey of higher education institutions in the United States and where they stand in terms of their use of e-learning. It identifies the challenges that are facing institutions as they attempt to implement e-learning and makes some interesting recommendations for what institutions need to do to make effective use of e-learning. This report covers many of the issues that we touch  on in this unit as well as units 3, 4 and 6.

### 2.9 Conclusion <a name="conclusion"></a>

In this unit we have tried to give you an overview of the key factors that determine how ready an organization is for e-learning. By analyzing these factors, you can determine what needs to be addressed in an organization to make it "e-learning ready". Some of these factors will be discussed in more depth in later units.

As we mentioned at the outset, e-learning readiness is much more than just a technical issue, although technical readiness is a key component. E-learning readiness is a complex issue that  includes a wide range of organizational, pedagogical and administrative factors as well as the technical issues. The key readiness issues are:
<ul>
	<li>Costs and funding</li>
	<li>IT infrastructure</li>
	<li>Organizational culture</li>
	<li>Planning</li>
	<li>Faculty and learner readiness</li>
	<li>Organizational structure</li>
</ul>
