In this unit we will take a look at government planning and policy for e-learning. Clearly governments play a key role in public education (and to a lesser extent, private education) and while funding for public higher education has been on the decline in many jurisdictions, governments still wield considerable influence. This means they have the potential to influence the use of e-learning.

### Key Points <a name="keypoints"></a>
After completing this unit government planning for e-learning, we want you to come way with the following key points.
#### 1. Government Planning Strategies
We find it useful to think about two categories of strategies that governments have at their disposal for planning e-learning.

<strong>Conservative Strategies</strong>  
These include:
* regulation
* supporting and promoting competition
* establishing the jurisdiction of public sector institutions
* supporting and enhancing the developing of partnerships and consortia.

<strong>Radical Strategies</strong>  
These include:
<ul>
	<li>creating new e-learning institutions</li>
	<li>encouraging the private sector and international providers</li>
	<li>using e-learning to transform post-secondary education</li>
	<li>developing or facilitating a national e-learning business sector</li>
	<li>Develop or facilitate a national archive of e-learning materials</li>
</ul>  
#### 2. Duplication  
In order to minimize the potential for increased costs, governments should develop strategies to avoid the costly duplication of courses, programs and resources and to prevent institutional "mission creep". <strong>
</strong>  
#### 3. Funding Strategies  
Governments also have a number of different funding strategies at their disposal. These include:
<ul>
	<li>reallocating existing resources</li>
	<li>creating new institutions</li>
	<li>increasing tuition fees</li>
	<li>providing short term grants for e-learning initiatives</li>
	<li>increasing government funding for educational institutions</li>
	<li>using e-learning to absorb new enrollments</li>
	<li>encouraging the development of cost-recoverable e-learning programs</li>
	<li>allow public institutions to create for-profit e-learning companies</li>
</ul>
E-learning is not cheap and, in the short term, governments should expect to spend more to invest in the development of e-learning in order to pay for the technical and human resource infrastructure. In the medium to long term, e-learning does provide opportunities to increase the cost-effectiveness of higher education by improving access and quality.
#### 5. Readiness for E-learning  
A key role for government in helping to stimulate and support the use of e-learning in the post secondary sector is understanding how "e-learning ready" the jurisdiction is and identifying what steps need to be taken to improve readiness. A useful framework for examining e-learning readiness is "the four Cs": Connectivity, Capability, Content and Culture.

### 5.1 The Role of Government <a name="role"></a>  
In <em>National Strategies for E-Learning</em>, Bates (2001) examines the role of governments in planning and directing e-learning in higher education and some of the key strategies available to governments. He poses some key questions about access and connectivity within a country, the function and organization of education and training sectors (and how such existing organizations are under pressure due to the impact of e-learning), and new or radical ways to re-imagine the provision of education and training at the national level. The specific challenges and strategies that he highlights relate to key priorities that motivate governments to play a role in the planning and management. Bates lists the following priorities:
<ul>
	<li>the delivery of cost-effective instruction to under-served populations and regions;</li>
	<li>increasing the capacity of all institutions and programs to utilize the power of technology to carry out their teaching, research, and service functions;</li>
	<li>a more fully articulated system of post-secondary education and training where transitions from one institution and sector to another are enhanced;</li>
	<li>greater capacity of post-secondary education and training institutions to meet the economic development goals of the state and the continuing lifelong learning needs of its citizens;</li>
	<li>a more informed set of consumers about choices and programs available from state, international and private institutions;</li>
	<li>a better conception of what constitutes best practice in the field of e-learning,;</li>
	<li>a financing, planning and accountability process that can be used to justify the significant investments of public funds required to achieve these goals. (p. 30)</li>
</ul>

#### Government Planning
There are a variety of ways that governments can intervene to influence the development of e-learning. These range from simply tinkering with the existing system and institutions or creating the right technical infrastructure, to more radical approaches that might involve the creation of new institutions, merging or reorganizing existing institutions and using e-learning to rethink and transform how education is delivered.

Regardless of how radical or conservative an approach governments take, funding plays a key role and there are variety of funding strategies that can be used to implement a government e-learning agenda. These include, among other things, reallocating existing funding, providing targeted funding for e-learning, allowing institutions to increase tuition fees and developing new business models for developing online programs.

One of the points that Bates makes throughout <em>National Strategies for E-Learning</em> is that, regardless of political ideology, governments have a role to play in creating the appropriate conditions for e-learning.

<em>A government can play a number of strategic roles in the area of technology planning in post-secondary education and training. On the one hand, its academic and financing policies can encourage all institutions to utilize e-learning. On the other hand, it can articulate and operationalize a collective vision for the state post-secondary system with respect to the place and role of e-learning, distributed learning and distance education within the system. (p. 29)</em>

The conservative, radical and funding strategies are highlighted in the following sections. They are discussed more fully in chapters 3, 4 and 6 of <em>National Strategies for E-Learning.</em>

### 5.2 Government Planning Strategies <a name="planning"></a>
#### Radical Strategies
Radical strategies include:
<ul>
	<li>creating new e-learning institutions;</li>
	<li>encouraging the private sector and international providers;</li>
	<li>using e-learning to transform postsecondary education;</li>
	<li>developing a national repository of e-learning materials.</li>
</ul>
#### Examples of Radical Strategies: Creating New Institutions
The development of e-learning within the higher education and training sector need not only take place within existing institutional structures and traditional models for the delivery of education. Governments can, for instance, create new institutions or draw in new partners to participate in the provision and development of the educational infrastructure.

One of the most recent developments in Canada is the creation of the Ontario Online Institute. This new institution is intended to be ‚Äúa facilitator, enabler, and funder of online learning in Ontario and Ontario‚Äôs education and training providers rather than a regulator, controller or acquirer of assets. ‚Äú It is expected to administer an online course development fund, coordinate the development of student support services, library services and faculty training. Full details are contained in the <a href="http://www.tcu.gov.on.ca/pepg/publications/ooi_may2011.pdf" target="_blank">report of the Special Advisor on online learning.</a>

On the other hand, one of most enduring radical initiatives was the creation of the <a href="http://www.open.ac.uk/" target="_blank">Open University in the United Kingdom</a>. Although the UKOU was established in 1969, long before the advent of e-learning, it has since evolved into one of the world‚Äôs largest online universities. More recently, in 2000, the UK established the UK e-University, whose primary objective appears to have been to market its programs internationally. This was disbanded in 2004.

In the United States, the governors of 19 Western states established the <a href="http://www.wgu.edu/" target="_blank">Western Governors University </a>in 1998. The WGU is a public online university that uses a competency-based and personalized learning approach. It is a very interesting institution that is guided by five themes:
<ul>
	<li>Responsiveness to employment and societal needs.</li>
	<li>A focus on competency-based education.</li>
	<li>Expanding access.</li>
	<li>Cost-effectiveness.</li>
	<li>Development of a technology infrastructure.</li>
</ul>
In British Columbia, the provincial government created the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Learning_Agency" target="_blank">Open Learning Agency</a> and the associated Open University and Open School components in the 1980s. By encouraging (and partially funding) a consortium of higher education institutions, the province was able to pool approximately 500 courses from several institutions to create a new, distance education university to provide access to students who cannot easily come to the cities to take their studies. Access is a particularly important issue in a province with a total population of 4.1 million and a land-base that is 947,800 sq km in size! The Open University of British Columbia directly addressed government priorities relating to the delivery of cost-effective instruction (via correspondence and distance education), with full articulation and student mobility between post-secondary institutions, and the increase in the capacity of provincial post-secondary and training institutions. In 2004, the Open University of BC was closed, along with the Open Learning Agency it was part of, and the operations were taken over by the newly-created Thompson Rivers University, based in Kamloops.

The BC government also created a number of other new and fairly innovative institutions with mandates for e-learning: <a href="http://www.royalroads.ca/" target="_blank">Royal Roads University</a> and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_University_of_British_Columbia" target="_blank">Technical University of BC</a> (later taken over by Simon Fraser University) in the 1990s and <a href="http://www.bccampus.ca/" target="_blank">BC Campus</a> in the 2003.

Elsewhere in Canada we have <a href="http://www.athabascau.ca/" target="_blank">Athabasca University</a>, modeled after the UK Open University and the <a href="http://www.teluq.ca/" target="_blank">T√©l√©-Universit√©, </a>Canada's francophone online university, which is part of the <a href="http://www.uquebec.ca/reseau/" target="_blank">Universit√© de Qu√©bec</a>.
#### Conservative Strategies
Conservative strategies include:
<ul>
	<li>regulation;</li>
	<li>supporting and promoting competition;</li>
	<li>establishing the jurisdiction of public sector institutions;</li>
	<li>supporting and enhancing the developing of partnerships and consortia.</li>
</ul>
#### Examples of Conservative Strategies
Governments play a key role in influencing the competitive environment within the higher education and training sectors. For instance, in British Columbia, almost all of the higher education institutions are publicly-funded, so they operate within the environment defined by the provincial government. Some institutions have been established as Universities, which means that they can offer degrees and conduct research. Others have been established as colleges, which means that they can offer two year programs and certificates, but not degrees. Such institutions typically provide service to students seeking professional and trade-related training. In the 1990s the provincial government created a hybrid institution, the university-college, which started out as a regular college but was given the authority to also offer four year degree programs. More recently, the status of these university colleges was changed to ‚Äúteaching universities‚Äù. The provincial government, therefore, defines the overall post-secondary educational environment and the roles of the various institutions..

The national context and the infrastructure within the higher education and training sector are important, particularly because it would be very difficult (if not impossible) for individual institutions to handle the cost of developing e-learning alone. Quite simply, the costs and risks are too high, and for this reason, Bates (2001) suggests the value of partnerships and consortia models. Such collaborative approaches often go against traditional competitive relationships between regionally-based institutions. The strategic pooling of resources capable by such collaborations greatly increases the viability and breadth of e-learning initiatives.

Consider the example of the partnerships between the University of British Columbia and <a href="http://www.itesm.mx/wps/portal?WCM_GLOBAL_CONTEXT=" target="_blank">Tec de Monterrey in Mexico</a>. This partnership has resulted in student and faculty exchanges and several undergraduate and joint degree programs, including the MET, although the MET partnership was ended several years ago.

The Province of Ontario provides us with another example of a relatively conservative strategy for stimulating the use of e-learning as part of a broader strategy to increase access and strengthen the post-secondary system. In November 2013 Ontario released its <a href="http://www.tcu.gov.on.ca/pepg/publications/PolicyFramework_PostSec.pdf" target="_blank">Differentiation Policy Framework </a>which is intended to "build on and help focus the well-established strengths of institutions, enable them to operate together as complementary parts of a whole, and give students affordable access to the full continuum of vocational and academic educational opportunities that are required to prosper in our contemporary world."

One of the six components of the Differential Policy Framework is Teaching &amp; Learning which is where e-learning is addressed:
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"<em>This component captures institutional strengths in program delivery methods that expand learning options for students and improve their learning experience and career preparedness. This may include, but is not limited to, experiential, entrepreneurial, work- integrated, and online learning.</em>
<em> Institutions will focus on areas of educational strength and specialty so that they offer the maximum choice, flexibility, and quality experience to Ontario students. This includes institutions strengthening their innovative teaching approaches, such as technology-enabled learning and experiential learning opportunities, to provide students with a twenty-first century learning experience."</em></p>
The government required all 45 public colleges and universities in the province to develop <a href="http://www.tcu.gov.on.ca/pepg/publications/vision/" target="_blank">Strategic Mandate Agreements </a>that specified how they were going to address the goals of the Differentiation Policy Framework in the each of the six components. If you look at these <a href="http://www.tcu.gov.on.ca/pepg/publications/vision/" target="_blank">SMAs</a> you will see a heavy emphasis on the use of e-learning in various forms.
#### Avoiding Duplication
When most higher education institutions have the capacity to develop e-learning programs, the potential for unnecessary duplication within a publicly-funded system becomes a major problem. That is not to say that duplication and overlap do not exist within conventional offerings. In fact, one of the drivers behind Ontario's Differentiation Policy Framework just discussed is to try to reduce or eliminate unnecessary duplication across the system in all forms of delivery. But with e-learning, the rationale for institutions offering the same courses and programs becomes even weaker since the courses can be accessed from almost anywhere. It just makes no sense for every college to offer English 100 to every student in the same state or province.

There are several strategies open to government to prevent this, from policy to regulation to collaboration to "free market" competition with, in the latter case, the strongest department winning and the weakest closing down. The just discussed Differentiation Policy Framework in Ontario is an example of a policy approach. Regulation is more difficult because the Internet does not respect state or provincial boundaries, and students now have access to online programs from all over the world. Still, accreditation is a key factor in how students decide which institutions to attend. Collaboration is a better approach, but difficult to implement without some strong financial encouragement from governments. Organizations like BC Campus and the newly-created <a href="http://www.cou.on.ca/policy-advocacy/online" target="_blank">Ontario Online Institute</a> are designed to foster collaboration by making funding contingent on it but while <a href="http://bccampus.ca/" target="_blank">BC Campus</a> has been a positive influence on the post secondary sector it's ability to promote significant and systemic collaboration has been limited . Despite the rhetoric of collaboration, the public post secondary environment is still highly competitive.

The important role for governments if they wish to avoid unnecessary duplication is to watch for ‚Äòmission creep‚Äô. Mission creep occurs when two year colleges want to become a four year degree awarding institutions, comprehensive state universities want to become research institutions, research universities want to offer associate (two-year) degrees, and everyone wants to make money from the Internet. Probably the most important and effective strategy is for government to use its program approval processes to ensure that institutions keep to agreed mandates.

### 5.3 Government Funding Strategies <a name="funding"></a>
#### Bad News, Worse News and Good News
It has already been pointed out that the bad news for governments is that e-learning is unlikely to save money in higher education, at least in the short term. The cost of technology obsolescence and advancement, and above all the cost of faculty learning how to use the technology and/or the costs of the technical support they will require, will continue to mean that more rather than less money will need to be spent over the next ten years or so.

Secondly, high quality learning requires interaction between students, and between students and teachers. While teaching can be re-organized to maximize investment in e-learning, and online discussions can be organized to keep faculty time under control, higher education is a people-intensive process, so if the quality of learning is to be maintained or improved, then there is a limit to the cost savings to be made from investing in e-learning.

The recent emergence of Massively Open Online Courses (MOOCs) may challenge this notion but the jury is still out on what impact MOOCs will have on costs and quality. MOOC proponents argue that by using peer assessment, self-testing and lower cost tutorial assistants to provide learner support the MOOC model can help improve access and lower costs. It is still too early to accurately assess these claims.

The worse news is that governments will probably have to invest more in technology, not to save money, but to ensure that universities and colleges are developing the skills and knowledge needed in a knowledge-based society.

The good news is that e-learning does provide opportunities for greater cost-effectiveness, in terms of reaching out to more learners, especially those already in the workforce, and for higher quality learning, such as problem-solving, information management, and decision-making skills. But this will only be achieved if e-learning is appropriately funded and, more importantly, appropriately planned and managed.

So if institutions want to use e-learning effectively, increased funding will be necessary. We are probably not talking about huge increases  (less than 5%), and there are a number of ways of finding this extra money. However, most institutions have very little room for maneuver in terms of reallocation of existing funding which limits their options. While one-time funding is useful for certain elements of capital expenditure, the major costs are in salaries for support staff, which are recurrent operating costs.

Some of the possible funding strategies include:
<ul>
	<li>reallocating existing resources;</li>
	<li>creating new institutions;</li>
	<li>increasing tuition fees;</li>
	<li>providing short term grants for e-learning initiatives;</li>
	<li>increasing government funding for educational institutions;</li>
	<li>using e-learning to absorb new enrollments;</li>
	<li>encouraging the development of cost-recoverable e-learning programs;</li>
	<li>allowing public institutions to create for-profit e-learning companies.</li>
</ul>
#### One Funding Strategy: Targeted Funding
Funding is probably one of the most effective tools that governments can use to implement its goals for higher education. Since the late 1980s many governments have turned to funding strategies to influence the behaviour of even large research universities. One typical strategy is for government to hold back funds for innovation or technology investment, as a means of encouraging change. Several provincial governments have put money into different ‚Äòenvelopes‚Äô, to encourage individual professors to collaborate across institutions to develop technology enhanced teaching materials.

In 1992 the British Columbia government withheld 2.5% of the operating grant of post secondary institutions and allowed them to reapply for it if they could demonstrate they would use it to support innovation in teaching and learning. Indeed, the development of WebCT was supported out of this innovation fund. Similar ‚Äúfunding envelope‚Äù approaches have been used in Alberta and Saskatchewan.

Sometimes funding strategies are combined with more radical institutional strategies. As an example, BC Campus administers and online program development fund that post secondary institutions bid on by submitting proposals on an annual basis. More recently, it created a <a href="http://bccampus.ca/open-textbook-project/" target="_blank">program to support the development of open textbooks</a>. The new Ontario Online Institute is expected to adopt a similar approach. This approach to funding is meant to encourage institutions to use e-learning.

However, how effective are such strategies in bringing about fundamental change in institutions? Indeed, is it appropriate for governments to interfere in this way? For instance, could such policies lead to the development of collectives of Lone Rangers, whose influence on an institution disappears as soon as the funding stops? If institutions do not respond to these funding opportunities strategically, the goal of using e-learning to address key priorities may not be achieved. My experience at two BC post secondary institutions is that often the proposals that are submitted to these funds are not aligned with any strategic institutional goals but, rather. are designed to support individual pet projects of the faculty members concerned. So targeted funding is only one element in achieving greater and more effective use of e-learning. It must be accompanied by planning at the institutional level that clearly identifies e-learning as a strategy. Bates (2001) identifies a number of other issues that need to be addressed If a government is interested in using e-learning as an opportunity for change:
<ul>
	<li>Do the institutions have the necessary resources (financial, technical and management) to support e-learning?</li>
	<li>What can government do to facilitate the process of change towards greater use of e-learning?</li>
	<li>Is e-learning the most appropriate means to bring about change; would the same investment in resources and effort in other areas bring better results? (Bates, p. 75)</li>
</ul>
This last point is an extremely important one, as e-learning is not a panacea for all problems that face higher education and training institutions. If we are uncritical in our application of e-learning, we are unlikely to be very successful in our efforts. More seriously, we are likely to undermine the credibility of e-learning as a viable strategy or approach to meet current challenges.

### 5.4 National Readiness for E-learning <a name="national"></a>
In 2003, <em>The Economist</em> prepared an extensive ‚Äúe-readiness‚Äù survey of leading industrialized countries. The survey included a separate examination of e-learning readiness. While this survey is somewhat dated, the process and criteria used, and the issues that were identified are still relevant in 2015. According to the survey, the network, as well as the people to support it, is a critical precondition for the development and viability of e-learning:

<em>‚ÄúWhatever strategies governments choose to adopt themselves or leave to the private sector, it needs to be recognized that the effective use of e-learning for education and training purposes is absolutely dependent on a widely accessible and low-cost national telecommunications infrastructure.‚Äù (p. 44).</em>

<em>The Economist </em>report also stresses how important governments are in nurturing the foundation of network connectivity:

‚Äú<em>Much of the advancement in Internet usage ‚Äì and even e-business adoption ‚Äì can be credited to government initiative.  The reverse is also true: government inaction and poorly conceived intervention can be blamed for impeding e-readiness in many countries‚Äù</em> (p. 21).

The related e-learning readiness survey speaks even more clearly about the impact of government policy on the development of e-learning. The two e-learning leaders in this survey from the southeast Asian region are South Korea and Singapore which rank number 5 and 6 and <em>The Economist</em> makes it very clear that this is due, in large part, to their governments: ‚ÄúThe governments of South Korea and Singapore are‚Ä¶ aggressive in promoting online learning. ‚ÄòFrom as young as kindergarten, e-learning is being used,‚Äô says An Gie Foo, a manager in education at International Enterprise Singapore, the restructured Singapore Trade Development Board.‚Äù (p. 7)

This e-learning readiness survey sets out a means of assessing the extent to which a country is prepared to develop and sustain e-learning activities. As well, by comparing 60 different countries and providing an analysis of the different strategies that are having a direct impact on the relative level of readiness of the sample group, the ‚Äúe-learning Readiness Survey‚Äù highlights some important factors that should be considered in the planning and management of education at all levels. So, while the results and national rankings might be different today, the process used and issues raised are still relevant. <em>The Economist</em> survey suggests that ‚Äúe-learning readiness means more than connectivity. The best-connected countries in the world, led by Singapore and South Korea, are not necessarily the top e-learners. Other building blocks ‚Äì including a strong education system and a wealth of online content ‚Äì are also necessary, as is a willingness to adapt to new ways of learning‚Äù (p. 3). The e-learning Readiness Survey arranged the criteria into four main areas, four Cs: connectivity, capability, content, and culture.

Let‚Äôs take a closer look at the 4 Cs.
#### Connectivity
We‚Äôve already spent some time considering the question of connectivity and access to the Internet as a precondition of e-learning. If students are unable to access the Internet, there is little chance that e-learning initiatives will dramatically change educational practices within a country. Further, connectivity within the survey considers access beyond the campus. Increasingly, citizens in the most connected countries in the world have almost unlimited and ubiquitous access to the Internet, in their homes, their schools and any other place they choose. One of the most significant changes related to connectivity to emerge since this survey was conducted is mobile access. Increasingly, Internet access in the industrialized world is mobile.
#### Capability
Capability refers to the extent to which a country values education and training. It is not enough to merely provide connectivity: there has to also be a general acceptance of the value and importance of life-long learning, education and on-going development of skills and training. In essence, this criteria speaks to the issue of a knowledge economy and the concrete steps that society is taking to ensure that its citizens are ready to live and work within such an economy.
#### Content
Content refers to the wide availability of information via the Internet in all areas of a person‚Äôs life. An important characteristic here is that such content should also be freely available in the native language of the country. This is a considerable challenge when one considers the extent to which English, as a language, currently dominates the Internet. It is also a challenge in terms of the applicability of reusable media, e-learning platforms and the various interfaces we use that may or may not be available in one‚Äôs native language. The availability of open educational resources is an increasingly important issue in this regard.
#### Culture
Culture is probably one of the most complex criteria of the e-learning survey, in part because it is such a broad category and because it cuts across so many different contexts: national, institutional, professional and personal. The extent to which e-learning is seen as an important way in which such goals are achieved is a good indicator of how much support there is for e-learning. At the institutional level, we have suggested the e-learning requires a dramatic shift in the organizational culture within most educational institutions; such shifts are also called for in other sectors of society.

So as you consider the role of government in planning e-learning, it is important to consider how ‚Äúe-learning ready‚Äù your country, state or province is. Effective government policies will recognize and address these issues. Implementing conservative, radical and/or funding strategies will have limited impact if the underlying issues of connectivity, capability, content and culture have not been addressed and taken into account in those strategies.

### 5.5 Conclusion <a name="conclusion"></a>
Governments play a key role in the planning and management of e-learning. They provide the framework under which the post secondary institutions operate and they should provide a clear vision and concrete goals for the system. Institutional planning, then, needs to be aligned to these goals. Beyond that, governments have the opportunity to get more directly involved in helping to implement e-learning more broadly through a range of strategies than can include fairly conservative measures to adjust existing institutional arrangements to more radical approaches that involve restructuring, creating new institutions and using funding to achieve national or provincial/state e-learning goals. Underpinning these strategies is the jurisdiction‚Äôs e-learning readiness and governments need to factor in issues of connectivity, capability, content and culture in any policies designed to promote e-learning.
